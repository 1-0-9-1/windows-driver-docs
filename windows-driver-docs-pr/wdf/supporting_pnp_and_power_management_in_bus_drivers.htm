<p>Some devices are permanently plugged into the system, while others can be plugged in and unplugged while the system is running. <i>Bus drivers</i> must identify and report the devices that are connected to their bus, and they must discover and report the arrival and departure of devices in the system. </p>
<p>The devices that a bus driver identifies and reports are called the bus's <i>child devices</i>. The process of identifying and reporting child devices is called <i>bus enumeration</i>. During bus enumeration, the bus driver <a href="creating_a_framework_device_object.htm">creates device objects</a> for its child devices. For more information about bus enumeration, see <a href="enumerating_the_devices_on_a_bus.htm">Enumerating the Devices on a Bus</a>.</p>
<p>Bus drivers are essentially function drivers, or rarely a filter driver, that also handle bus enumeration. A bus driver is typically the function driver for the bus adapter, but it is not the function driver for the child devices that are connected to the bus. </p>
<p>Bus drivers also have the same PnP and power management responsibilities that function drivers have. For information about these responsibilities, see <a href="supporting_pnp_and_power_management_in_function_drivers.htm">Supporting PnP and Power Management in Function Drivers</a>.</p>
