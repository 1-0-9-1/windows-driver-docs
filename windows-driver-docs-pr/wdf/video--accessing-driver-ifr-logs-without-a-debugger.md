# Video: Accessing driver IFR logs without a debugger

This topic contains a video tutorial that shows how a driver can access IFR logs without a debugger attached.

To learn how to configure your driver to use Inflight Recorder (IFR), see [Using Inflight Trace Recorder (IFR) in KMDF and UMDF 2 Drivers](using-wpp-software-tracing-in-kmdf-and-umdf-2-drivers.md).

You can find the **GetIfr.ps1** script described in the video in the [WDF GitHub repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-Driver-Frameworks).
