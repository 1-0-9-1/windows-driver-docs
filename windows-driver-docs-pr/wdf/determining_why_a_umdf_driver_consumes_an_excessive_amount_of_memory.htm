</div>
<p>This topic describes how you can use the Wudfext.dll debugger extensions in conjunction with a User-Mode Driver Framework (UMDF) version 1 driver to determine why a UMDF driver consumes an excessive amount of memory.</p>
<p>Starting with UMDF version 2, you should instead use the Wdfkd.dll debugger extensions. For more info, see <a href="debugger.kernel_mode_driver_framework_extensions__wdfkd_dll_">Windows Driver Framework Extensions (Wdfkd.dll)</a>.</p>
<p>To investigate memory usage, use the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>View the outstanding object in the object tree by using the <b>!wudfext.wudfobject</b> UMDF debugger extension. </p>
<p>The <b>!wudfext.wudfobject</b> extension displays information about a WDF object, which includes its parent and child relationships. If you set bit 0 of the <i>Flags</i> parameter to 1 (0x01), <b>!wudfext.wudfobject</b> performs a recursive dump of the object tree that is rooted at the object that you passed. To view the complete object tree, use the following example command:</p>
<p><b>!wudfext.wudfobject &lt;IWDFDriver*&gt; 1</b></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine if you see more outstanding objects than you expect.</p>
<p>Your driver might eventually leak these objects (for more information about leaking WDF objects, see <a href="determining_if_a_driver_leaks_framework_objects.htm">Determining If a Driver Leaks Framework Objects</a>).</p>
<p>These objects might be in the object tree and would therefore eventually be freed. However, they are being accumulated unnecessarily. These objects might require:</p>
<ul>
<li>Corrections to their parent objects. </li>
<li>Explicit deletion by using the <a href="wdf.iwdfobject_deletewdfobject"><b>IWDFObject::DeleteWdfObject</b></a> method. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
