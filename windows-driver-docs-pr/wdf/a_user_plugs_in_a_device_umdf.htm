<p class="CCE_Message">[This topic applies to UMDF 1.<i>x</i>.]</p>
<p>When a user plugs in a device, the framework calls  a UMDF driver's PnP and Power Management callback methods in the following sequence, starting from the Device Arrived state at the bottom of the figure:</p><img src="images/umdf_powerup_sequence.png" alt="Device enumeration and startup sequence for a UMDF driver"/><p>The framework begins by calling the driver’s <a href="wdf.idriverentry_ondeviceadd"><b>IDriverEntry::OnDeviceAdd</b></a> callback so that the driver can create a device callback object and a framework device object to represent the device. The framework continues calling the driver’s callback routines by progressing up through the sequence until the device is operational.</p>
<p>The framework proceeds through this sequence for each UMDF function or filter driver that supports the device, one driver at a time, starting with the driver that is lowest in the driver stack.</p>
