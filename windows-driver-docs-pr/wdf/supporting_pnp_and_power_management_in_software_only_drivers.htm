<p><i>Software-only drivers</i> are drivers that do not access any hardware. Some software-only drivers reside in a driver stack that does not access hardware.  Because these drivers do not access hardware, they typically do not have to perform any PnP or power management operations. </p>
<p>Other software-only drivers are filter drivers: they reside in a stack of drivers that do access hardware, but the filter drivers do not access hardware.  When a filter driver receives an I/O request that specifies a PnP or power management operation, the driver typically just passes the request to the next driver. The framework intercepts these requests and passes them on, so framework-based drivers never see the requests.</p>
<p>If you are writing a software-only driver, your driver <a href="creating_a_framework_device_object.htm">creates device objects</a> but you typically do not need to provide any event callback functions to handle PnP or power management events. If the driver uses <a href="framework_queue_objects.htm">framework queue objects</a>, you will need to set the <b>PowerManaged</b> member of the queue's <a href="wdf.wdf_io_queue_config"><b>WDF_IO_QUEUE_CONFIG</b></a> structure to <b>WdfFalse</b> or <b>WdfUseDefault</b>.</p>
<p>A few software-only drivers are also <a href="supporting_pnp_and_power_management_in_function_drivers.htm">function drivers</a>. In other words, a single driver might act as a software-only driver to support a virtual device that does not access hardware, and as a function driver to support a hardware device.</p>
