<h1><a id="wdf.request_ownership"></a>Request Ownership</h1>
</div>
<p>When the I/O manager sends an I/O request to a framework-based driver, the framework intercepts the request and creates a framework request object. The framework "owns" the request object, because only the framework can access the request and perform operations on the object.</p>
<p>After the framework creates a request object, it places the object in one of the driver's I/O queues. The framework continues to own the request object until it removes the request from the queue and delivers it to the driver.</p>
<p>After the driver <a href="receiving_i_o_requests.htm">receives</a> the request object, it owns the request. The driver can access the request object through a handle and perform operations on the object. While the driver owns the request object it can <a href="requeuing_i_o_requests.htm">requeue</a>, <a href="completing_i_o_requests.htm">complete</a>, <a href="canceling_i_o_requests.htm">cancel</a>, or <a href="forwarding_i_o_requests.htm">forward</a> the request, after which it no longer owns the request object and cannot access it.</p>
<p>As ownership of a request object passes between a driver and the framework, the object handle's value does not change. For example, if a driver receives a request from an I/O queue, requeues it to a different queue, and then receives the request again, the handle's value will not change. Likewise, if a driver forwards a request to an I/O target and later receives notification that the I/O target completed the request, the driver's notification callback function receives the same handle value that the driver supplied to the I/O target.</p>
