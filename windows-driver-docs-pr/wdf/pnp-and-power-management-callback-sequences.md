# PnP and Power Management Callback Sequences


The following topics show the sequence in which the framework calls a KMDF driver's PnP and Power Management event callback functions:

-   [Power-Up Sequence for a Function or Filter Driver](power-up-sequence-for-a-function-or-filter-driver.md)
-   [Power-Up Sequence for a Bus Driver](power-up-sequence-for-a-bus-driver.md)
-   [Power-Down and Removal Sequence for a Function or Filter Driver](power-down-and-removal-sequence-for-a-function-or-filter-driver.md)
-   [Power-Down and Removal Sequence for a Bus Driver](power-down-and-removal-sequence-for-a-bus-driver.md)
-   [Surprise-Removal Sequence](surprise-removal-sequence.md)
