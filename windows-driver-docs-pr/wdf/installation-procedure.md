# Installation Procedure


Kernel-Mode Driver Framework (KMDF) and User-Mode Driver Framework (UMDF) drivers are installed by using INF files, just as WDM drivers are. However, framework-based drivers must use the appropriate co-installer and must add information about the additional service that is required for KMDF or UMDF.

For implementation details, see [Building, Installing, and Testing](building--installing--and-testing-a-wdf-driver.md).
