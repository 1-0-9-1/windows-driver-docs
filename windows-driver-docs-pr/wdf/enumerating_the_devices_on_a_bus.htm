</div>
<p><i>Bus enumeration</i> is the act of determining which child devices are connected to a parent device. A parent device is typically a bus adapter, but it can also be a device that supports multiple functions, such as a sound card, for which each function requires a separate set of drivers. </p>
<p>Kernel-Mode Driver Framework (KMDF)  supports two types of bus enumeration: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="static_enumeration.htm">Static enumeration</a>, which is easy to implement and is ideal if the number and type of child devices is not system-specific and does not change after the hardware has been plugged in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="dynamic_enumeration.htm">Dynamic enumeration</a>, which should be used if the number or type of child devices changes from one computer to another.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A bus driver can use either or both types of bus enumeration.</p>
<p>For more information about writing a KMDF bus driver, see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/gg463281">Bus Driver Development Based on KMDF</a>.</p>
