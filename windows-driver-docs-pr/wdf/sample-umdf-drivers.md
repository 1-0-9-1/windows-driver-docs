# Sample UMDF Drivers


This topic lists available User-Mode Driver Framework (UMDF) sample drivers that you can download from the [Windows driver samples repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-driver-samples) on GitHub.

[Windows 8.1 driver samples](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowshardware/Windows-Driver-Kit-WDK-81-cf35e953) can be downloaded from the [Windows Hardware Dev Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=616506).

## UMDF 2 Samples


-   [Sample Function Driver for OSR USB-FX2 (UMDF Version 2)](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/tree/master/usb/umdf2_fx2)
-   [Toaster Sample (UMDF Version 2)](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/tree/master/general/toaster/umdf2)
-   [Echo Sample (UMDF Version 2)](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/tree/master/general/echo/umdf2)

## UMDF 1 Samples


-   [GPIO Sample Drivers](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/tree/master/gpio/samples)
-   The HID client sample driver (Fx2Hid) sample was removed in Windows 8.1. If you are writing a Universal Windows app that communicates with a HID device, you'll use the Windows.Devices.Custom namespace to access the device's HID collections directly. For more information, see the [Custom driver access](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=618584) sample app and the [HidUsbFx2](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/tree/master/hid/hidusbfx2) sample driver. If you are writing a Win32 application that accesses a HID collection, refer to the [HClient sample application](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/tree/master/hid/hclient).
