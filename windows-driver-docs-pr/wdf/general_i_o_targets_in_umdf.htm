<p class="CCE_Message">[This topic applies to UMDF 1.<i>x</i>.]</p>
<p>General I/O targets, which can be either <i>local</i> or <i>remote</i>, are I/O targets that do not support special, device-specific data formats, such as USB request blocks. Before drivers send data to a general I/O target, they must put data into a write buffer in a format that the I/O target and device can interpret. Likewise, when drivers read data from a general I/O target, the drivers must be able to interpret the contents of data buffers that they receive from the target.</p>

<dd>
<p>Drivers often send I/O requests to the next-lower driver in the driver stack. Therefore, each UMDF-based driver has a <i>default I/O target</i> for each device, which is the device's next-lower driver. The default I/O target for the lowest-level UMDF-based driver is the kernel-mode <a href="overview_of_the_umdf.htm">reflector</a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes a UMDF-based driver must send I/O requests to a file-handle-based I/O target, such as a file or a network socket. Therefore, the framework also provides file-handle-based I/O target objects. </p>
<p>Both the default I/O target and file-handle-based I/O targets are called <i>local I/O targets</i>, because UMDF-based drivers use these targets to send I/O requests to devices that the driver stack supports.</p>

      </b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Occasionally, a driver must send an I/O request to a different driver stack. Therefore, the framework also provides <i>remote I/O targets</i>, which consist of all of the I/O targets except local I/O targets. </p>
<p>A remote I/O target might be a device that the driver stack does not support, a file on that device, or a <a href="using_device_interfaces_in_umdf_drivers.htm">device interface</a> for that device. </p>
