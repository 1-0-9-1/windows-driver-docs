<p class="CCE_Message">[This topic applies to UMDF 1.<i>x</i>.]</p>
<p>The following figure shows the flow of operations that occur to and from the UMDF functional driver in a single device stack.</p><img src="images/umdfflow.gif" alt="UMDF call sequence for create file followed by a read request"/><div class="alert"><b>Note</b>    All I/O that is initiated by applications is routed through kernel mode as shown in the figures in the <a href="wdf.architecture_of_the_umdf">Architecture of the UMDF</a> section, even though the preceding figure does not show this situation.</div>
<div> </div>
<p>The UMDF driver calls the <a href="wdf.iwdfiorequest_getcreateparameters"><b>IWDFIoRequest::GetCreateParameters</b></a> method only if it requires information about the file that is associated with the read request. The UMDF driver calls the <a href="wdf.iwdfiorequest_getreadparameters"><b>IWDFIoRequest::GetReadParameters</b></a> method only if it requires more information about the read request. </p>
<p>The UMDF driver can call the <a href="wdf.iwdfiorequest_complete"><b>IWDFIoRequest::Complete</b></a> method rather than the <a href="wdf.iwdfiorequest_completewithinformation"><b>IWDFIoRequest::CompleteWithInformation</b></a> method if specifying the number of bytes that are transferred in the read operation is not required. The UMDF driver calls <b>Complete</b> or <b>CompleteWithInformation</b> to signal that the read operation is complete; the application can then access the read data.</p>
