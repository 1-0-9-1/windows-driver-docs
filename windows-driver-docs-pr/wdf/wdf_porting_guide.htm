<p>The topics in this section describe how to convert an existing WDM driver to a Kernel-Mode Driver Framework (KMDF) driver or a User-Mode Driver Framework (UMDF) version 2 driver.</p>
<p>
Architecturally, Windows Driver Frameworks (WDF) drivers are similar to WDM drivers. A WDM driver consists of a <a href="kernel.driverentry"><i>DriverEntry</i></a> function, various dispatch routines that the operating system calls to service I/O requests, and additional driver-specific utility functions.  A WDF driver consists of a <a href="wdf.driverentry_for_kmdf_drivers"><b>DriverEntry</b></a> function, various event callback functions that the framework calls to service I/O requests, and additional driver-specific utility functions.  However, within this broad structure, the two models have important differences.</p>
