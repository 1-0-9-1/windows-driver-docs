<p>This topic describes the Microsoft-supplied redistributable framework updates that are included as part of the  Windows Driver Kit (WDK) for Windows 8.1, and how to determine which ones to add to your driver package.</p>
<p>To determine if you need to include any framework updates at all in your driver package, see <a href="building_and_loading_a_kmdf_driver.htm">Building and Loading a WDF Driver</a>. If you don't, skip this topic.</p>
<h2><a id="Should_I_include_the_co-installer_or_the_.msu_file_"></a><a id="should_i_include_the_co-installer_or_the_.msu_file_"></a><a id="SHOULD_I_INCLUDE_THE_CO-INSTALLER_OR_THE_.MSU_FILE_"></a>Should I include the co-installer or the .msu file?</h2>
<p>If your driver installation is triggered by plugging in a new hardware device to a system and you are installing only the driver, include the co-installer in your driver package. Then reference the co-installer in your INF file, as described in <a href="installing_the_framework_s_co_installer.htm">Specifying the  KMDF Co-installer in an INF File</a>.</p>
<p>If you need to install  an application in addition to your driver, you should instead redistribute the relevant MSU package (for example kmdf-1.11-Win.6.0.msu) along with a setup application that calls it.  You can find a sample of such an application in the WDK, in the src\general\installwdf directory.</p>
<p>In the latter case, no INF entries are needed.</p>
<h2><a id="Where_can_I_find_these_files__and_what_s_included_"></a><a id="where_can_i_find_these_files__and_what_s_included_"></a><a id="WHERE_CAN_I_FIND_THESE_FILES__AND_WHAT_S_INCLUDED_"></a>Where can I find these files, and what's included?</h2>
<p>When you build your driver in Visual Studio, MSBuild places  the co-installer in the resulting Package directory, along with the driver's .<i>sys</i> and INF files.</p>
<p>The full set of redistributable framework update files is located in <i>%programfiles%</i>\windows kits\<i>&lt;WDK version&gt;</i>\redist\wdf.</p>
<p>This directory contains the following files, for x86 and x64:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>WdfCoinstaller01009.dll</i>, <i>wdfcoinstaller01011.dll</i> (co-installers for KMDF 1.9/1.11).</li>
<li><i>WUDFUpdate_01009.dll</i>, <i>WUDFUpdate_01011.dll</i> (co-installers for UMDF).</li>
<li><i>winusbcoinstaller.dll</i>, <i>winusbcoinstaller2.dll</i>  (co-installers for WinUSB 1.5/1.9).</li>
<li><i>WinUSB_1.9.msu</i> – WinUSB version 1.9 update, also available as <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971286">KB971286</a>.</li>
<li><i>kmdf-1.11-Win-6.0.msu</i>, <i>kmdf-1.11-Win-6.1.msu</i> - Windows Update package for KMDF 1.11 for Windows Vista (v6.0) / Windows 7 (v6.1).</li>
<li><i>umdf-1.11-Win-6.0.msu</i>, <i>umdf-1.11-Win-6.1.msu</i> – Windows Update package for UMDF 1.11 for Windows Vista (v6.0) / Windows 7 (v6.1).</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="Co-installer_Naming_and_Versioning"></a><a id="co-installer_naming_and_versioning"></a><a id="CO-INSTALLER_NAMING_AND_VERSIONING"></a>Co-installer Naming and Versioning</h2>
<p>The co-installer is named 
       <b>WdfCoInstaller</b><i>MMmmm</i><b>.dll</b>.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>MM</i> is the major version number.</li>
<li><i>mmm</i> is the minor version number.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the filename for version 1.0 of the co-installer is <i>WdfCoInstaller01000.dll</i>, and the filename for version 1.11 is <i>WdfCoInstaller01011.dll</i>.</p>
<p>The version of the co-installer that you include with your driver package must match the version of the framework library that you use to develop your driver.</p>
<p>Note that the framework library's file name includes only the major version number. For more information about library file names, see <a href="framework_library_versioning.htm">Framework Library Versioning</a>.</p>
