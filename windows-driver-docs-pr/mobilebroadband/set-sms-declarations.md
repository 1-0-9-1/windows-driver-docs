A Windows Store app that uses SMS must declare SMS capability in its package manifest in Visual Studio.

Example **package.appxmanifest**:

``` syntax
  <Capabilities>
    <DeviceCapability Name="sms" />
  </Capabilities>
```

For more information, see [App capability declarations (Windows Store apps)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=317125).

The mobile broadband device can determine which apps it trusts to send and receive SMS messages. To do so, it adds the package name that it trusts in the [Service metadata](service-metadata.md), as shown in the following entry:

**\\Package\\SoftwareInformation\\SoftwareInfo.xml**

``` syntax
<PrivilegedApplications>
  <Package>
    <Identity Name="Microsoft.SDKSamples.SMSSendReceive.JS" Version="1.0.0.0" Publisher="CN=Contoso Corporation, O=Contoso Corporation, L=Redmond, S=Washington, C=US" />
  </Package>
```
