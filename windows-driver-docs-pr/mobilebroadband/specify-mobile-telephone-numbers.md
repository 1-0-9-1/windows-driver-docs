# Specify mobile telephone numbers


Telephone numbers must be specified in ITU E.164 format. SMS clients are encouraged to store telephone numbers in ITU E.164 international format and use a library to convert ITU E.164-format telephone numbers into a regional, common written format.

The following table is an example:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="33%" />
<col width="33%" />
<col width="33%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Region</th>
<th>ITU E.164 international</th>
<th>Common written format</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>United States of America</p></td>
<td><p>+15551234567</p></td>
<td><p>(555) 123-4567</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
