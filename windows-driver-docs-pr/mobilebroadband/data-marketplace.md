# Data Marketplace

With Data Marketplace, you can bring your brand to customers using Windows-based laptops and tablets by presenting your offerings when they search for connectivity. 

By integrating with Data Marketplace, you can offer pay-as-you-go (PAYG) data plans to customers through the Windows Store, as well as letting customers subscribe to your plans directly.  When customers purchase your PAYG plans from the Windows Store, you can leverage the millions of customers who already have Microsoft accounts and payment instruments on file with Microsoft, leading to a simple, frictionless purchase process.  

Data Marketplace provides a native Windows experience that doesnâ€™t require a Wi-Fi connection for customers to make purchases. Your plans will be front and center when no other connectivity options exist.  As a participant in Data Marketplace, you have the opportunity to capture revenue from previously non-addressable customers. PAYG plans let customers experience the value in connecting a laptop or tablet to mobile broadband, and Data Marketplace makes buying connectivity as easy as buying an app.
