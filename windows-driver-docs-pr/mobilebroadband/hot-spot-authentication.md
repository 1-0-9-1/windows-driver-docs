# Hot spot authentication


You should offload data traffic to Wi-Fi hot spots whenever possible. Windows Connection Manager can automatically connect to Wi-Fi networks when they are available. To connect to Wi-Fi networks, you must provide hotspot credentials to Windows. You can provide hotspot credentials through account provisioning metadata, or you can use implement your own authentication in the app.

For info about how you can enable hot spot authentication by using your mobile broadband app, see these topics:
