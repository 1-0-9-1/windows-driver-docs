# Hot spot authentication


You should offload data traffic to Wi-Fi hot spots whenever possible. Windows Connection Manager can automatically connect to Wi-Fi networks when they are available. To connect to Wi-Fi networks, you must provide hot-spot credentials to Windows. You can provide hot-spot credentials through account provisioning metadata, or you can use implement your own authentication in the app.

For info about how you can enable hot-spot authentication by using your mobile broadband app, see [Using metadata to configure mobile broadband experiences](using-metadata-to-configure-mobile-broadband-experiences.md).
