# Review the hotspot authentication sample


The [Hotspot Authentication Sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=313215) demonstrates the application of a provisioning file and how it handles a hotspot authentication event. This sample does not run with privileged APIs; it demonstrates the application of signed provisioning metadata.

For an example of how to use unsigned provisioning metadata together with privilege APIs, see the [Mobile Broadband Provisioning sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=256401).
