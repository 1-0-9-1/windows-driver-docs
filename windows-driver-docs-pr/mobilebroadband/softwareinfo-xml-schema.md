# SoftwareInfo XML schema


A metadata package contains one SoftwareInfo.xml document, which contains information that the operating system downloads a Windows Store app. This information results in privileged access for apps.

The data within the Softwareinfo.xml document is formatted based on the SoftwareInfo XML Schema, which is described in this section.

**Note**  
The XML document must be saved by using UTF-8 encoding.

 

For the complete definition of the SoftwareInfo XML schema, see [SoftwareInfo XML Schema Definition](softwareinfo-xml-schema-definition.md).

For information about the elements that are defined by the SoftwareInfo XML schema, see [SoftwareInfo XML Schema Definition](softwareinfo-xml-schema-definition.md).

For an example of XML data in the format that is defined by the SoftwareInfo XML schema, see [SoftwareInfo XML Example](softwareinfo-xml-example.md).
