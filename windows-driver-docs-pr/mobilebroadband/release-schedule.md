# Appendix B: Data Marketplace release schedule

Data Marketplace enables Windows customers to seamlessly obtain the Internet connectivity they need to remain productive, wherever they are located. The feature set we will deliver in Windows 10, version 1709 is a major investment and step forward with that vision, particularly with regard to cell network connectivity for PCs.

The table below summarizes our release schedule for Windows 10, version 1709. We have two major milestones. Both M1 and M2 will be generally available to customers with the Windows 10, version 1709 release. M1 has been committed and the [Review and launch](review-and-launch.md) article covers the expected Data Marketplace UX for M1. We are currently planning for M2 and some of the highlighted M2 features are listed in the table below.

Useful also for helping to mitigate eSIM-related device compatibility issues. **And more…** |
