# Using BDA Property and Method Sets


## <a href="" id="ddk-using-bda-property-and-method-sets-ksg"></a>


The following sections show how BDA property and method sets are used to implement a BDA minidriver:

[Determining BDA Device Topology](determining-bda-device-topology.md)

[Mapping Connection Topology](mapping-connection-topology.md)

[Determining the Controlling Pin of a Node](determining-the-controlling-pin-of-a-node.md)

[Configuring a BDA Filter](configuring-a-bda-filter.md)

[Changing BDA Filter Properties](changing-bda-filter-properties.md)

[Accessing Frequency Properties of a BDA Tuner Node](accessing-frequency-properties-of-a-bda-tuner-node.md)
