# EVENTSETID\_TUNER


## <span id="ddk_eventsetid_tuner_ks"></span><span id="DDK_EVENTSETID_TUNER_KS"></span>


The **EVENTSETID\_Tuner** event set notifies clients when a tuner change event occurs, such as switching a channel, and when a tuning device completes a scan operation.

The following event items in this set are specified in the KSEVENT\_TUNER enumeration:

[**KSEVENT\_TUNER\_CHANGED**](ksevent-tuner-changed.md)

[**KSEVENT\_TUNER\_INITIATE\_SCAN**](ksevent-tuner-initiate-scan.md)

**Note**   The KSEVENT\_TUNER\_INITIATE\_SCAN event is new for Windows Vista.
