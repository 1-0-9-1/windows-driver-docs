# Control Nodes, Filters and Hardware


## <a href="" id="ddk-control-nodes-filters-and-hardware-ksg"></a>


BDA control nodes in BDA receiver topology can be separated into individual filters or combined in filters. In addition, BDA control nodes can be associated with hardware or be software-only components. The following sections describe:

[Control Nodes](control-nodes.md)

[Combining Nodes in a Filter](combining-nodes-in-a-filter.md)

[Separating Nodes in Individual Filters](separating-nodes-in-individual-filters.md)

[Control Nodes for Processing IP Data](control-nodes-for-processing-ip-data.md)
