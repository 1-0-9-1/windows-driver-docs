# AVC\_FUNCTION\_ACQUIRE


## <span id="ddk_avc_function_acquire_ks"></span><span id="DDK_AVC_FUNCTION_ACQUIRE_KS"></span>


The **AVC\_FUNCTION\_ACQUIRE** function code causes *avc.sys* to establish any connections suggested by cached AVCCONNECTINFO values.

### <span id="i_o_status_block"></span><span id="I_O_STATUS_BLOCK"></span>I/O Status Block

If successful, the AV/C protocol driver sets **Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status** to STATUS\_SUCCESS.

Possible other return values include:

<tr class="odd">
<td><p>STATUS_TIMEOUT</p></td>
<td><p>The request was made, but no response was received before all time-out and retry processing was complete.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>STATUS_REQUEST_ABORTED</p></td>
<td><p>Immediately abort when the IRP completion status is STATUS_REQUEST_ABORTED. This indicates that the device has been removed or is no longer available on the 1394 bus.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>STATUS_*</p></td>
<td><p>Any other return code indicates that an error or warning occurred that was beyond the scope of the AV/C protocol.</p></td>

This function uses the **PinId** member of the AVC\_MULTIFUNC\_IRB structure as shown below.

```
typedef struct _AVC_MULTIFUNC_IRB {
  AVC_IRB  Common;
  union {
    .
    .
    .
    AVC_PIN_ID PinId;
 .
    .
    .
  };
} AVC_MULTIFUNC_IRB, *PAVC_MULTIFUNC_IRB;
```

The **Function** submember of this member must be set to **AVC\_FUNCTION\_ACQUIRE** from the AVC\_FUNCTION enumeration.

<span id="PinId"></span><span id="pinid"></span><span id="PINID"></span>**PinId**  
Specifies the offset (or ID) of the pin for which a connection is to be acquired.

This function code is not supported by virtual instances of *avc.sys*.

A subunit driver must use this function when the pin becomes active.

This must be called at IRQL = PASSIVE\_LEVEL.
