# Kernel Streaming Interface Sets


## <span id="ddk_kernel_streaming_interface_sets_ks"></span><span id="DDK_KERNEL_STREAMING_INTERFACE_SETS_KS"></span>


This section documents kernel streaming interface sets. It contains the following topics:

[KSINTERFACESETID\_Media](ksinterfacesetid-media.md)

[KSINTERFACESETID\_Standard](ksinterfacesetid-standard.md)

These sets correspond to GUIDs that are defined in *ks.h* and *ksmedia.h*, and can be specified in the [**KSPIN\_INTERFACE**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563537) structure.

For information about how to specify interfaces in your minidriver, see [KS Interfaces](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567652).
