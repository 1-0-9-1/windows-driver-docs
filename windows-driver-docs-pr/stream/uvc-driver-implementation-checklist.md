# Step 1: Get started with USB Video Class (UVC) using documentation from usb.org and MSDN

Use these links to get acquainted with UVC:

    * Access the [USB class](http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/devclass_docs/) documentation (non-UVC specific) at usb.org

    * Dowmload the [USB Video Class 1.5](http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/devclass_docs/USB_Video_Class_1_5.zip) documentation from usb.org

    * Review the [USB Video Class driver overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/stream/usb-video-class-driver-overview) on MSDN 

# Step 2: Implement the platform-supplied Device MFT

    * The platform-supplied Device MFT is for RGB USB cameras. It provides common functionality, for example, face detection based ROI for 3A prioritization (if the camera firmware supports ROI control specified in UVC 1.5 standard).

    * To enable this functionality, IHVs and OEMs only need to ensure that the camera supports ROI. If the OEM or IHV needs to disable this functionality, they must do so through registry keys (for example, an INF file entry). 

    * For more information, see [DMFT chaining](TBD IRFormatTypesForUVCCameras_External_001.pdf).

# Step 3: Implement the custom Device MFT and MFT0 for your device

    * Device MFT is a user-mode component of UVC. OEMs and IHVs can insert this component to add extensions and differentiators to the UVC.

    * Review the [Device MFT design guide](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/stream/dmft-design)

    * Review the [Device MFT sample code](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/tree/master/avstream/sampledevicemft) located on GitHub.

    * Review the [MFT0 sample code](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn394064) â€“ Creating a camera driver MFT for a Windows Store device app. Note that the Device MFT model supersedes the MFT0 model. While Windows continues to support the MFT0 model, IHVs and OEMs are encouraged to use Device MFT instead, as it simplifies the design and supports more functionality and scalability.

# Step 4: Implement Microsoft-specified UVC extensions

    *  [USBVideo.sys updates](TBD USBVideo.sys_Updates%20-%20Functional_External_47.0.pdf)

    * [Microsoft extensions to USB Video Class 1.5 specification](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/stream/uvc-extensions-1-15)

    * [Infrared (IR) stream media type guidance](TBD IRFormatTypesForUVCCameras_External_002.pdf)

    * Method 2 still image capture:

        * Locate the introduction in the official USB documentation you downloaded and unzipped in Step 1 above:

            * Open the *UVC 1.5 Class specification.pdf* document and locate the section for *Method 2* (around page 17)

        * Microsoft-specific documentation:

            * Section 3 in [USBVideo.sys Updates](TBD USBVideo.sys_Updates - Functional_External_47.0.pdf) where the registry key needed to light-up Method 2 in the platform is described

            * Section 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 in [Microsoft extensions to USB Video Class 1.5 specification](TBD)

# Step 5: Test your UVC implementation to ensure it meets required functionality and performance

    * Run [Microsoft-provided HLK tests](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn930814)

    * [Camera-specific HLK tests](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn941930)

    * Ensure the camera is compliant with any requirements and HLK tests for other products that the camera also should be compliant with (for example, Skype, Windows Hello, and so on).
