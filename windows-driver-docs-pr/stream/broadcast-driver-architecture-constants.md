# Broadcast Driver Architecture Constants


## <span id="ddk_broadcast_driver_architecture_constants_ks"></span><span id="DDK_BROADCAST_DRIVER_ARCHITECTURE_CONSTANTS_KS"></span>


A BDA minidriver uses the following constants:

<span id="BDA_Filter_Category_GUIDs"></span><span id="bda_filter_category_guids"></span><span id="BDA_FILTER_CATEGORY_GUIDS"></span>[BDA Filter Category GUIDs](bda-filter-category-guids.md)  
BDA minidrivers use these GUIDs to specify the types of BDA filters to create.

<span id="BDA_Node_Category_GUIDs"></span><span id="bda_node_category_guids"></span><span id="BDA_NODE_CATEGORY_GUIDS"></span>[BDA Node Category GUIDs](bda-node-category-guids.md)  
BDA minidrivers use these GUIDs to specify the types of BDA nodes to create.

<span id="BDA_Pin_Name_GUIDs"></span><span id="bda_pin_name_guids"></span><span id="BDA_PIN_NAME_GUIDS"></span>[BDA Pin Name GUIDs](bda-pin-name-guids.md)  
BDA minidrivers use these GUIDs to specify the names of pins they support.

<span id="BDA_Stream_Format_GUIDs"></span><span id="bda_stream_format_guids"></span><span id="BDA_STREAM_FORMAT_GUIDS"></span>[BDA Stream Format GUIDs](bda-stream-format-guids.md)  
BDA minidrivers use these GUIDs to specify the data formats they support.

<span id="Broadcast_Network_Type_GUIDs"></span><span id="broadcast_network_type_guids"></span><span id="BROADCAST_NETWORK_TYPE_GUIDS"></span>[Broadcast Network Type GUIDs](broadcast-network-type-guids.md)  
BDA minidrivers use these GUIDs to specify the broadcast network types that they support for scanning operations.

**Note**   The BDA constants are available on Windows XP and later. These constants are available on the Windows 2000 platform only if DirectX 9.0 and later is installed on that platform.
