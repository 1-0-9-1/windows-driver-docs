# AVC\_FUNCTION\_GET\_PIN\_COUNT


## <span id="ddk_avc_function_get_pin_count_ks"></span><span id="DDK_AVC_FUNCTION_GET_PIN_COUNT_KS"></span>


The **AVC\_FUNCTION\_GET\_PIN\_COUNT** function code obtains the number of pins supported by the underlying subunit device.

### <span id="i_o_status_block"></span><span id="I_O_STATUS_BLOCK"></span>I/O Status Block

If successful, the AV/C protocol driver sets **Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status** to STATUS\_SUCCESS.

Possible other return values include:

<tr class="odd">
<td><p>STATUS_TIMEOUT</p></td>
<td><p>The request was made, but no response was received before all time-out and retry processing was complete.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>STATUS_REQUEST_ABORTED</p></td>
<td><p>Immediately abort when the IRP completion status is STATUS_REQUEST_ABORTED. This indicates that the device has been removed or is no longer available on the 1394 bus.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>STATUS_*</p></td>
<td><p>Any other return code indicates that an error or warning occurred that was beyond the scope of the AV/C protocol.</p></td>

  union {
    AVC_PIN_COUNT PinCount;
 .
    .
    .
  };
} AVC_MULTIFUNC_IRB, *PAVC_MULTIFUNC_IRB;
