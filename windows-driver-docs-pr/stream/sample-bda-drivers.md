# Sample BDA Drivers


## <a href="" id="ddk-sample-bda-drivers-ksg"></a>


The Windows Driver Kit (WDK) version 7600 that shipped with Windows 7 includes samples that show the principles and features of Broadcast Driver Architecture (BDA) and how a BDA minidriver uses the AVStream class driver. These samples are working implementations with source code that can serve as a starting point for you to write a proprietary BDA minidriver.

When you install the WDK version 7600, you can install these samples. Each BDA driver sample is installed in the \\src\\Swtuner\\ subdirectory under the main directory of your WDK installation. For more information about these samples, see the source code for each BDA driver sample in the WDK.

These samples are not available on the MSDN code gallery or in the WDK version 8 that shipped with Windows 8.
