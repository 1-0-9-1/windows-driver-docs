# Filter Graph Examples


The flexibility of DirectShow enables numerous filter graph configurations that mirror the capabilities of the underlying hardware.

Video capture minidrivers can expose a variety of filters that correspond to their underlying hardware topology. Possible filter graph configurations include:

[USB or 1394 based conferencing camera](usb-or-1394-based-conferencing-camera.md)

[USB based camera with a capture button](usb-based-camera-with-a-capture-button.md)

[PCI based TV capture](pci-based-tv-capture.md)

[Video port based capture](video-port-based-capture.md)
