# Loading Highlight Data


## <span id="ddk_loading_highlight_data_gg"></span><span id="DDK_LOADING_HIGHLIGHT_DATA_GG"></span>


The [**DXVA\_Highlight**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563979) structure specifies a highlighted rectangular area of a subpicture, and is used along with DCCMD data and a DPXD surface to create an alpha-blending surface. The highlight data is formatted in a manner compatible with the DVD ROM specification. For further clarification of DVD subpicture definition and data field interpretation, see *DVD Specifications for Read-Only Disk: Part 3 - Video Specification (v. 1.11, May 1999)*.
