# General Install Information


Generally, all references to out-of-box or production and retail binaries, services, and add-registry or del-registry sections that are typically part of your retail Microsoft Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL) driver packages are not listed in the Windows Vista in-box driver packages.

Examples of these types of references cannot be listed because they vary so much per vendor. However, typically, you should not refer to anything that is required by your OpenGL installable client drivers' (ICDs) help files, out-of-box services, polling applications, and so on.
