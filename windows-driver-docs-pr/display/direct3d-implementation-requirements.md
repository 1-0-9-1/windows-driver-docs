# Direct3D Implementation Requirements


## <span id="ddk_direct3d_implementation_requirements_gg"></span><span id="DDK_DIRECT3D_IMPLEMENTATION_REQUIREMENTS_GG"></span>


The purpose of this section and the following subsections is to provide detailed descriptions of the Windows Logo requirements for hardware with respect to exposed features. This section includes descriptions of features that are present in the PC2001 Design Guide.

Feature compliance is generally assured by comparing a scene rasterized by the hardware to an identical scene rasterized by the reference rasterizer. Each feature must conform to the reference rasterizer as described in the following topics:

[Render Target Requirements](render-target-requirements.md)

[Point, Line, and Triangle Filling Requirements](point--line--and-triangle-filling-requirements.md)

[Shading Requirements](shading-requirements.md)

[Texturing Requirements](texturing-requirements.md)
