# DirectX 9.0 Release Notes


## <span id="ddk_directx_9_0_release_notes_gg"></span><span id="DDK_DIRECTX_9_0_RELEASE_NOTES_GG"></span>


The following sections contain update information for DirectX 9.0 and focus on those areas of the DDI that have been modified or extended for DirectX 9.0:

[Header Files for DirectX 9.0 Drivers](header-files-for-directx-9-0-drivers.md)

[Required DirectX 9.0 Driver Support](required-directx-9-0-driver-support.md)

[Recommended DirectX 9.0 Driver Support](recommended-directx-9-0-driver-support.md)

[Optional DirectX 9.0 Driver Support](optional-directx-9-0-driver-support.md)

Note that the DirectX 9.0 runtime only supplies hardware acceleration in any form if the display driver is a DirectX 7.0 or later driver (that is, the driver supports at least the DirectX 7.0 DDI).

The [Updates for Windows DDK](updates-for-windows-ddk.md) section contains update information for specific versions of the Microsoft Windows Driver Development Kit (DDK) with which the DirectX 9.0 DDK is installed.

The [Updates for Earlier DirectX DDK Versions](updates-for-earlier-directx-ddk-versions.md) section contains update information that applies to version 9.0 as well as to prior versions.
