## <span id="ddk_restricted_profiles_gg"></span><span id="DDK_RESTRICTED_PROFILES_GG"></span>


This section provides information about the following restricted profiles that can be supported by Microsoft DirectX VA.

These restricted profiles are defined in anticipation of combinations of features likely to find widespread support. They establish a set of video coding tools necessary for decoding and also determining whether a given video data format can be decoded in some fashion using the DirectX VA API.

[H261\_B](h261-b.md)

[H263\_A](h263-a.md)

[H263\_B](h263-b.md)

[H263\_C](h263-c.md)

[H263\_D](h263-d.md)

[H263\_E](h263-e.md)

[H263\_F](h263-f.md)
