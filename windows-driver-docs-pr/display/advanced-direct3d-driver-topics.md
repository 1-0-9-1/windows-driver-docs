# Advanced Direct3D Driver Topics


## <span id="ddk_advanced_direct3d_driver_topics_gg"></span><span id="DDK_ADVANCED_DIRECT3D_DRIVER_TOPICS_GG"></span>


This section describes Microsoft Direct3D specialty topics and optimizations. These features are not central to implementing core functionality in a Direct3D driver; they should be implemented later in the driver development process, after core driver functionality is completed.

The topics described in this section are:

[Optimized Textures](optimized-textures.md)

[Stencil Planes](stencil-planes.md)

[Guard Band Clipping](guard-band-clipping.md)

[Extents Adjustment](extents-adjustment.md)

[W-Buffering](w-buffering.md)

[Bump Mapping](bump-mapping.md)

[Hardware Transform and Lighting](hardware-transform-and-lighting.md)
