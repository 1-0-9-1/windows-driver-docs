# COPP Video Miniport Driver IOCTL Template Code


## <span id="ddk_copp_video_miniport_driver_ioctl_template_code_gg"></span><span id="DDK_COPP_VIDEO_MINIPORT_DRIVER_IOCTL_TEMPLATE_CODE_GG"></span>


This section applies only to Windows Server 2003 SP1 and later, and Windows XP SP2 and later.

The video miniport driver must implement a [*HwVidStartIO*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567367) function to process the I/O requests that originate in the display driver. The following example code shows only how the video miniport driver processes COPP IOCTLs:

```
BOOLEAN
HwVidStartIO(
    PHW_DEVICE_EXTENSION pHwDeviceExtension,
    PVIDEO_REQUEST_PACKET pVideoRequestPacket
    )
{
    VP_STATUS vpStatus;
    switch (pVideoRequestPacket->IoControlCode)
    {
        case IOCTL_COPP_OpenDevice:
            vpStatus = IoctlCOPPOpenDevice(pHwDeviceExtension, pVideoRequestPacket);
            break;
        case IOCTL_COPP_GetCertificateLength:
            vpStatus = IoctlCOPPGetCertificateLength(pHwDeviceExtension, pVideoRequestPacket);
            break;
        case IOCTL_COPP_KeyExchange:
            vpStatus = IoctlCOPPKeyExchange(pHwDeviceExtension, pVideoRequestPacket);
            break;
        case IOCTL_COPP_StartSequence:
            vpStatus = IoctlCOPPStartSeqence(pHwDeviceExtension, pVideoRequestPacket);
            break;
        case IOCTL_COPP_Command:
            vpStatus = IoctlCOPPCommand(pHwDeviceExtension, pVideoRequestPacket);
            break;
        case IOCTL_COPP_Status:
            vpStatus = IoctlCOPPStatus(pHwDeviceExtension, pVideoRequestPacket);
            break;
        case IOCTL_COPP_CloseDevice:
            vpStatus = IoctlCOPPCloseDevice(pHwDeviceExtension, pVideoRequestPacket);
            break;
        default:
            vpStatus = ERROR_INVALID_FUNCTION;
            break;
    }
    pVideoRequestPacket->StatusBlock->Status = vpStatus;
    return TRUE;
}
```
