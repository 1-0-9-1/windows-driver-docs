# OPM Terminology


The following are the primary terms that are used with OPM:

<span id="Connector"></span><span id="connector"></span><span id="CONNECTOR"></span>**Connector**  
The physical output connection between the graphics adapter and a display device.

<span id="Protection_type"></span><span id="protection_type"></span><span id="PROTECTION_TYPE"></span>**Protection type**  
The type of protection that can be applied to a video signal that is passed through a graphics adapter's connector. More than one type of protection can be applied to a single connector.

<span id="Protection_level"></span><span id="protection_level"></span><span id="PROTECTION_LEVEL"></span>**Protection level**  
The level of protection that is applied to a video signal that is passed through a graphics adapter's connector. The level value is dependent on the protection type. Some protection types (for example, High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP)) have only two protection levels (for example, on and off).
