# Progressive Scan Monitors and Interleaved Data

On a proscan monitor, the lines are displayed as a frame -- that is, line 1 is displayed, then line 2, then line 3, and so on. The typical television set displays a *2:1 raster* -- that is, it displays the first field of a frame on the odd lines, and then it displays the second field of the frame on the even lines. Any material meant to be played on a television must be processed before being displayed on a proscan monitor.
