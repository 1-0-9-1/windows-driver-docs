# Limiting Repetitive GPU Hangs and Recoveries


Beginning with Windows Vista with Service Pack 1 (SP1) and Windows Server 2008, the user experience has been improved in situations where the GPU hangs frequently and rapidly. Repetitive GPU hangs indicate that the graphics hardware has not recovered successfully. In these situations, the end user must shut down and restart the operating system to fully reset the graphics hardware. If the operating system detects that six or more GPU hangs and subsequent recoveries occur within 1 minute, the operating system bug-checks the computer on the next GPU hang.
