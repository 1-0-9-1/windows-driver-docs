# GDI


## <span id="ddk_gdi_gg"></span><span id="DDK_GDI_GG"></span>


The topics in this section describe Graphics Device Interface (GDI) and its relationship to printer drivers and display adapter drivers.

Display adapter drivers that run on Windows Vista can adhere to one of two models: the Windows Vista display driver model or the Windows 2000 display driver model. The topics in this section apply to printer drivers and to drivers in the Windows 2000 display driver model, but they do not apply to drivers in the Windows Vista display driver model.
