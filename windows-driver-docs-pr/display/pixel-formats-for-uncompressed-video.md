## <span id="ddk_pixel_formats_for_uncompressed_video_gg"></span><span id="DDK_PIXEL_FORMATS_FOR_UNCOMPRESSED_VIDEO_GG"></span>


In order for applications to use uncompressed decoded pictures, pictures must be produced in a known video pixel format. The list of uncompressed picture formats supported by any DirectX VA accelerator must contain at least one of the pixel formats described in [4:2:2 Video Pixel Formats](4-2-2-video-pixel-formats.md) or [4:2:0 Video Pixel Formats](4-2-0-video-pixel-formats.md).
