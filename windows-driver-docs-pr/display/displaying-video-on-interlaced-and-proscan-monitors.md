# Displaying Video on Interlaced and Proscan Monitors

For the following two scenarios, interlaced video must be integrated for playback under Windows 2000 and later:

-   Interlaced content that is authored for display on an interlaced television and a computer with an interlaced monitor (NTSC/PAL).

-   Existing interlaced content that is authored for display on an interlaced television, which also needs to be displayed with the best-possible quality on a progressive scan (proscan) computer monitor.
