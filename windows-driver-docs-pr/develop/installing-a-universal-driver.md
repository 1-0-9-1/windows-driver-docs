# Installing a Universal Windows driver

A driver for any OneCoreUAP-based edition of Windows 10 other than Windows 10 for desktop editions (Home, Pro, and Enterprise) must be a [Universal Windows driver](getting-started-with-universal-drivers.md), and it must be installed using a *universal INF file*.

To install a Universal Windows driver on Windows 10 for desktop editions, we recommend using a universal INF file due to improved performance, but you can use a legacy (non-configurable) INF file.
