# Sample Biometric Driver


As you read the biometric design guide, you should also review the [WudfBioUsbSample](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/tree/master/biometrics/driver) sample. WudfBioUsbSample is a UMDF-based WBDI driver that ships in Windows 7 Beta and later versions of the WDK.

WudfBioUsbSample is based on the [umdf\_fx2](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/tree/3528ffbb369fa0611aefd14c97bdd6ac5ee50c41/usb/umdf_fx2) sample driver. For information specific to WudfBioUsbSample, see the [WudfBioUsbSample description](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/tree/master/biometrics).

This documentation refers to WudfBioUsbSample to show some of the requirements of a WBDI driver.
