# Testing Biometric Drivers


Microsoft recommends that all drivers run the static analysis tools in the WDK. For more information, see [Analyzing Driver Quality by Using Code Analysis Tools](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows-drivers/develop/analyzing_driver_quality_by_using_code_analysis_tools).

Also use the runtime tools, such as the [WDF Verifier Control Application](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556129) and [Application Verifier](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff541329).

Download the [Windows Hardware Certification Kit (HCK)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=733613) for tools to test Windows Biometric Framework driver packages with.
