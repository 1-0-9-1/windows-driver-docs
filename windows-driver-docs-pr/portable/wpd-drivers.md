# WPD Drivers


Microsoft Windows Portable Devices (WPD) enables a computer to communicate with attached media and storage devices. This system supersedes both Windows Media Device Manager (WMDM) and Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) by providing a flexible, robust way for a computer to communicate with music players, storage devices, mobile phones, and many other types of connected devices.

Microsoft provides several drivers for standard protocols and devices, including Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP), Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) devices, and Mass Storage Class (MSC) devices. If your device supports a unique protocol, you might need to develop your own driver. Use the Windows Driver Frameworks (WDF)-User-Mode Driver Framework (UMDF) to write this driver. For more information about this framework, see the [UMDF documentation](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=178692).

For more information about applications that are written for Windows Portable Devices, see the [WPD SDK documentation](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=178695).

For more information about both WPD driver development and WPD application development, see the [WPD Blog](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=178687).
