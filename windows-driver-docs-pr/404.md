# Error 404, driver doc page does not exist  

We're so very sorry, but the page you're attempting to get to just doesn't exist. There are at least 404 reasons for a 404, but the main culprits are these:
- It's hard to believe, but it may just be that we have a broken link. If you find one, please send an email to [windowsdriverdev@microsoft.com](mailto:windowsdriverdev@microsoft.com)
- A typo. Whether you manually entered the web address or clicked a link, a URL sometimes contains a mistake.
- The page no longer exists. Search engines might index one of our resources even after a we move or remove it. 
- The wrong file extension. If you tell the browser to find a .aspx page and the site has a .md version only, the site may serve a 404 error.
- Access. Perhaps you're trying to reach a private resource that requires permission. Make sure you're pointing at a public version.

Some other approaches to try:
- Try using the internal search box in the upper right corner of the page. That search is scoped to the Windows driver content.
- Start at the [Windows Driver Kit (WDK)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/drivers/index/) page and navigate by using the table of contents.
