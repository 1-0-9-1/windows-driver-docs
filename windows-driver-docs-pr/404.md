# Error 404, driver doc page does not exist  

We're so very sorry, but the page you're attempting to get to just doesn't exist. There are at least 500 reasons for a 404, but the main culprits are these:
- It's hard to believe, but it may just be that we have a broken link. Please send an email to [windowsdriverdev@microsoft.com](mailto:windowsdriverdev@microsoft.com)
- A typo. Whether you manually entered the web address or clicked a link, check that the URL doesn't contain a typo.
- The page no longer exists. Search engines sometimes index resources even after a site moves or removes them. 
- The wrong file extension. If you tell the browser to find a .aspx page and it has a .md version only, you may see a 404 error.
- Access. Perhaps you're trying to reach a resource that requires certain permissions. Make sure you're pointing at a public version.

Some other approaches to try:
- Try using the internal search box in the upper right corner of the page. The search is scoped to the Windows driver content and can give more focused results than a global search engine.
- Start at the [Windows Driver Kit (WDK)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/drivers/index/) page and navigate with the table of contents.
