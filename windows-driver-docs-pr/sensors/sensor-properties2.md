# Sensor properties


Starting with Windows 8.1, the new sensor driver model supports the use of properties that characterize the driver that is installed on the Windows device.

Each property is represented by a *property key*, a GUID value that identifies a property category and a property identifier. This topic contains information about the properties that partners can use to identify their sensor driver.
