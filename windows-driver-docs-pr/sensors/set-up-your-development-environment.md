# Set up your development environment


This topic shows you how to set up your development environment, to use the Sharks Cove board and Microsoft-provided software development tools, to build a universal sensor driver for your sensor.

Sharks Cove is a development board that has been designed and configured to be the core of an x86-based tablet platform. Additional devices such as cameras, sensors, a display etc. have been left out of the design of the board, so that new versions of these devices can be developed and tested using Sharks Cove.

You can order a Sharks Cove from [Mouser Electronics](http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/CircuitCo/999-0005112/?qs=%2fha2pyFadujHMsjnM70kKGG23vMNVMdDa094WOKuFgB8eIBF6%252bBXww%3d%3d).

Before you get started with this exercise, make sure that you have the following hardware:

-   Sharks Cove board, with included power cord and adapter
-   Test board with your sensor mounted on it
-   Powered USB hub
-   USB keyboard
-   USB mouse
-   USB network adapter
-   Monitor and HDMI cable (possibly with HDMI cable adapters)

For detailed instructions about how to connect and set up the hardware in the preceding list, see [Sharks Cove hardware development board](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn745910.aspx), and perform all the tasks up to, and including Step 4.

If you successfully completed the steps suggested in the preceding paragraph, then your development environment should now have the following:

-   Downloaded and installed Microsoft kits and tools
-   Sharks Cove with the correct version of Windows installed
-   Sharks Cove configured to receive and test a deployed driver

Follow the guidance in the next topic to [prepare your sensor test board](prepare-your-sensor-test-board.md) to be connected to the Sharks Cove board.
