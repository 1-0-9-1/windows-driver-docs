# What's new in NFC device drivers


This topic summarizes the new features and improvements for NFC device drivers in Windows 10.

In Windows 10, the NFC device driver model has converged for both desktop and mobile devices to create a universal NFC device driver model. Hardware partners can now build a single driver that can run on all Windows device platforms.

The NFC class extension (CX) implements the Windows-defined device driver interfaces to interact with the NFC controller, Secure Elements, and Remote RF endpoints.
