# For Administrators

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This content only applies to administration tasks for the Sysdev dashboard, which is being replaced by the Windows Hardware Dev Center Dashboard. See [Windows Hardware Dev Center Dashboard](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/dashboard/index) for current support and transition timelines.  

When you sign in to the Dashboard as an administrator, you can see more options than the general user.
