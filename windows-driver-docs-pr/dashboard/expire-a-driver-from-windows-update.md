# Expire a driver from Windows Update


To expire a driver from Windows Update, follow the steps below.

1.  [Find the hardware submission](manage-your-hardware-submissions.md) that contains driver you want to expire.

2.  Go to the **Distribution** section and select the shipping label that you want to modify.

3.  Go to the **Targeting** section.

4.  Under **Select PNPs**, choose the hardware IDs you want to expire.

    To expire specific hardware IDs, find each hardware ID and select **Expire**.
    
    To expire the entire shipping label, when all of the hardware IDs are published, click the **Expire All** button.
    
    If the **Expire All** option is not available, you can make it visible by simply clicking **Publish All**.  
    At this point the **Expire All** option will be available for you to select.  Click the **Expire All** button.
    
5.  Select **Publish** at the very bottom of the page.
