#Driver package metadata

The driver metadata package is a file associated to a submission. This file contains details about each INF file in a driver package or bundle. This file can be downloaded by using the [get a submission](get-a-submission.md) method. The file will be available in the [link object](get-product-data.md#link-object) of the submission with the *rel* - **driverMetadata**.
