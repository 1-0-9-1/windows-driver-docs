# Bug Management

Bug management enables you to receive driver bug notifications from Microsoft during the development of new Windows versions. 

To use the bug management feature, your organization must be registered with the Dashboard, and you must have permissions to manage bugs. See the standalone [Bug management document](http://aka.ms/collaboratedocs) for more information.
