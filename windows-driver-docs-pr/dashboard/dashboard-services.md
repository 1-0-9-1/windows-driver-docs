You can [certify your devices and apps for hardware certification](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=324025) using the legacy dashboard. You can also use the dashboard to manage submissions, track the performance of your device or app, and much more. To access the Dashboard, you’ll need [to register your company and get a code signing certificate](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=394273).
