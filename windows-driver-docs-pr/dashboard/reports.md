# Reports


Among the advantages that the Dashboard offers to you is a regular stream of reports. These reports capture information about the performance of your devices and software, whether in testing or released, that you can use to improve your products.

After you sign in to the Dashboard using your Microsoft account, Dashboard creates reports based on the products and company that you specify.

You customize the reports to show only the products and drivers that you want to see by using the Product Mapping Tool, which you can download from the Reports page on the Dashboard.
