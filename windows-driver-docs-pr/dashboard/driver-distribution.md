# Driver Distribution


After you have completed a driver submission, use the **Driver Distribution Center** to review and modify your driver distribution settings for Windows Update:

-   Sign in to the dashboard with your Microsoft account, and then on the left side of the page, click **Driver distribution**.
-   You will be presented with two options:
    -   Manage Windows 10 and above
        -   If your submission contains drivers for Windows 10 and above Operating systems this is where you can manage the distribution settings for your driver using one of the two tabs:
            -   [Manage driver distribution by submissions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt181351.aspx)
            -   [Manage driver distribution by devices](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt181350.aspx)
    -   Manage Windows 8.1 and below
        -   If your submission contains drivers for Windows 8.1 and below Operating systems this is where you can manage the distribution settings for your driver using one of the three tabs:

            -   [Devices Without Drivers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/br230802.aspx)
            -   [Driver Statistics](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/br230762.aspx)
            -   [Add or Remove Drivers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/br230805.aspx)

            After you click one of these tabs, you can filter the data by using the results filter, or enter the submission ID for a specific submission. For more information, see [Filter and Search Your Submissions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/br230792.aspx)
