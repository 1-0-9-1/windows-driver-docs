# GDL Snapshots


If there is no [GDL schema](gdl-schemas.md), the [GDL parser](gdl-parser.md) can create [XML snapshots](xml-structure-of-gdl-snapshots.md) of the source data for a specified [GDL configuration](gdl-configurations.md). If there is no schema, the parser verifies only that the source file is syntactically correct. It cannot determine if essential data is missing or if the structure of the tree conforms to what the client expected. Without a schema, the snapshot that is generated by the GDL parser contains the raw values, as they were defined in the source GDL file.

The following sections contain more information about GDL snapshots.

[GDL Parser](gdl-parser.md)
