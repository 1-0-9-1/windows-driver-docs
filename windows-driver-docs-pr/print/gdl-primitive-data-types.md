# GDL Primitive Data Types


The GDL parser filter has built-in support for *primitive data types*. Primitive data types are classified as passthrough, XML, enumerations, and filter-defined data types.

The following primitive datypes are used for GDL templates:

[Passthrough](passthrough-template-data-types.md)

[Native XML](native-xml-template-data-types.md)

[XSD](xsd-template-data-types.md)

[Enumerator](enumerator-template-data-type.md)

[Filter](filter-template-data-type.md)
