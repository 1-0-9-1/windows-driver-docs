# Printer Forms Support


Microsoft printer drivers can add custom forms to support special forms and paper sizes in a printer. You can add these forms to the system printer forms database by calling **AddForm** from the printer driver for each new form. Unidrv printer drivers can also specify additional forms in the [GPD file](introduction-to-gpd-files.md) for the printer driver.

For more information about how to add forms to the forms database, see [Adding Forms to the Forms Database](adding-forms-to-the-forms-database.md).
