# Iasphelp Automation Interface


## <span id="ddk_iasphelp_automation_interface_gg"></span><span id="DDK_IASPHELP_AUTOMATION_INTERFACE_GG"></span>


The Automation interface for the **Iasphelp** object enables an ASP Web page to obtain properties associated with a specified printer. The **Iasphelp** interface is supported in Windows 2000 and later versions of Windows. (However, the [**Iasphelp::IsCluster**](iasphelp-iscluster.md)property get operation is supported only in Windows XP and later versions of Windows.)

The programmatic identifier for the **Iasphelp** object is OlePrn.AspHelp.

For more information about how to access printers from ASP Web pages, see [Internet Printing](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551735).

The methods and "property get" operations in the **Iasphelp** interface are described in the following sections:

[Iasphelp Methods](iasphelp-methods.md)

[Iasphelp Property Get Operations](iasphelp-property-get-operations.md)
