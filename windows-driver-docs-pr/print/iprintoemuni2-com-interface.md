# IPrintOemUni2 COM Interface

The `IPrintOemUni2` COM interface contains all the methods of, and extends the capabilities of, the [IPrintOemUni COM Interface](iprintoemuni-com-interface.md).

The following table lists and describes all of the methods provided by the `IPrintOemUni2` interface. Rendering plug-ins must define all the listed methods. If a method is not needed, it can simply return E\_NOTIMPL.
