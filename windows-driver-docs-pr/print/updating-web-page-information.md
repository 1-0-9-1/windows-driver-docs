# Updating Web Page Information


## <a href="" id="ddk-updating-web-page-information-gg"></a>


The print server does not support server push for updating information about a print server Web page. Client pull operations are supported (assuming the user's browser recognizes HTML-specified "refresh" parameters) and can be included in customized pages. (For more information about client pull, refer to the appropriate HTML documentation.)
