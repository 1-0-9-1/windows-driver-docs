# PnPXID


The `PnPXID` command returns the Plug and Play (PnP) identifier (ID) in the form of the function discovery key, PKEY\_PNPX\_ID. This key returns the unique identifier of the service or device. The output buffer contains a NULL-terminated string that represents the identifier.

For more information about function discovery keys, see the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation.
