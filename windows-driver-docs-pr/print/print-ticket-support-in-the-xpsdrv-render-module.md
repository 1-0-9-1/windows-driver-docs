# Print Ticket Support in the XPSDrv Render Module


This section describes how to add Print Ticket processing to the rendering parts of a print driver and the descriptions in this section refer to filters in an XPSDrv print driver. XPSDrv filter module implementation is described in the [XPS Filter Pipeline](xpsdrv-printer-driver.md) section.

Print Ticket processing in the render module of a print driver consists of the following steps:

-   [Print Ticket Merging](print-ticket-merging.md)

-   [Print Ticket Parsing](print-ticket-parsing.md)
