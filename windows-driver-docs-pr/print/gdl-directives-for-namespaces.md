# GDL Directives for Namespaces


GDL has directives that establish namespaces for objects that can be shared by multiple GDL source files.

GDL contains the following namespace directives:

-   **\*DefineInNameSpace** specifies all definitions of sharable objects that belong to this namespace.

-   **\*UsingNameSpace** defines a namespace context to search for object references without an explicit namespace qualifier.

For more information about namespace directives, see [GDL Namespaces](gdl-namespaces.md).
