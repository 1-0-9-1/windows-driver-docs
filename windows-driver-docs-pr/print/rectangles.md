# Rectangles


## <a href="" id="ddk-rectangles-gg"></a>


To describe a rectangle in a GPD file, use the RECT keyword. The format is:

**RECT** ( *left* , *top* , *right* , *bottom* )

where *left*, *top*, *right*, and *bottom* represent [numeric values](numeric-values.md), in [master units](master-units.md).
