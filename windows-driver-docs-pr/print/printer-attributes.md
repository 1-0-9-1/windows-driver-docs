# Printer Attributes


## <a href="" id="ddk-printer-attributes-gg"></a>


Printer attributes are [GPD file entries](gpd-file-entries.md) that represent printer characteristics. To set an attribute's value, you include the attribute name and the desired value in the GPD file.

The following topics describe how to specify printer attributes in GPD files:

[Printer Attribute Format](printer-attribute-format.md)

[Attribute Types](attribute-types.md)

[General Attributes](general-attributes.md)
