# Extending the Bidi Communication Schema


The bidi communication schema can be extended by using a Bidi Extension, which is an XML file that defines new schemas. It applies constructs defined in the Bidi Extension Framework, an XSD standard that is available in Windows Vista and later versions of Windows.

The precise definition of the Bidi Extension Framework can be found in the tcpbidi.xsd file that is supplied with the Windows Driver Kit (WDK).

For more information about extending the schema, see [Customizing the Printer Port Monitors](customizing-the-printer-port-monitors.md).
