# Symbolic Names


## <a href="" id="ddk-symbolic-names-gg"></a>


A symbolic name is a character string used as an identifier. Symbolic names have the following characteristics:

-   The first character must be an uppercase or lowercase letter.

-   After the first character, the name can consist of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and the underscore character ( \_ ).

-   Names are case sensitive.

-   The number of characters in a name is unlimited.

The GPD language predefines a large number of symbolic names. Predefined names exist for [printer attributes](printer-attributes.md), [command names](command-names.md), [standard features](standard-features.md), [standard options](standard-options.md), and [standard variables](standard-variables.md).

You can define symbolic names for [customized features](customized-features.md), [customized options](customized-options.md), and [macros](macros.md).
