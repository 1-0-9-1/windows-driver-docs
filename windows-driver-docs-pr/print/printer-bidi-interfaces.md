# Printer Bidi Interfaces


A new set of printer bidirectional (Bidi) communication interfaces have been developed for the new version of the print driver model (V4 print driver model) in Windows 8.

These interfaces make it possible for the V4 print driver model to establish and maintain Bidi communication with a USB printer. These interfaces are only accessible via JavaScript code that runs in the print spooler. For more information about the spooler, see [Print Spooler Architecture](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff561105) and [Print Spooler Components](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff561109).

Here is a list of the Bidi interfaces.
