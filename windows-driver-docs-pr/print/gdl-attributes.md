# GDL Attributes


A GDL attribute is a keyword and value pair. The *value* is a piece of data, and the *keyword* is simply a tag that is used to identify the piece of data. Arbitrary keyword and data pairs are allowed as long as the GDL syntax rules are followed.

The following code example shows a GDL attribute.

```
*Weight: 330 pounds
```

In the preceding example, "\*Weight" is the keyword, and the "330 pounds" string is the value.
