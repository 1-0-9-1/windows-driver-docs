## <span id="ddk_com_interfaces_for_printer_web_pages_gg"></span><span id="DDK_COM_INTERFACES_FOR_PRINTER_WEB_PAGES_GG"></span>


The following Automation interfaces, implemented by Oleprn.dll, can be used within ASP files for creating printer Web pages:

[Iasphelp Automation Interface](iasphelp-automation-interface.md)

[IOleCvt Automation Interface](iolecvt-automation-interface.md)

Active Server Pages (ASP) technology and Automation are described in the Windows SDK Documentation. For more information about printer Web pages, see [Internet Printing](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551735).
