# Specifying Paper Sizes


## <a href="" id="ddk-specifying-paper-sizes-gg"></a>


Unidrv supports three categories of paper sizes--standard paper sizes, vendor-defined paper sizes, and user-defined paper sizes.

### Standard Paper Sizes

Standard paper sizes are those that are commonly supported by most printers. The dimensions of these paper sizes are predefined. For more information, see [Supporting Standard Paper Sizes](supporting-standard-paper-sizes.md).

### Vendor-Defined Paper Sizes

Vendor-defined paper sizes (also called nonstandard paper sizes) are defined by a printer vendor, within a printer's GPD file. For more information, see [Supporting Vendor-Defined Paper Sizes](supporting-vendor-defined-paper-sizes.md).

### User-Defined Paper Sizes

User-defined paper sizes (also called customized paper sizes) are defined by system administrators using the system's print folder, and thus are system-specific. For more information, see [Supporting User-Defined Paper Sizes](supporting-user-defined-paper-sizes.md).

For information about how to use the system locale to specify a default paper size, see [Referencing Locales](referencing-locales.md).
