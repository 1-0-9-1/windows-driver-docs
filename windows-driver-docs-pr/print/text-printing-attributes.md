## <a href="" id="ddk-text-printing-attributes-gg"></a>


Text printing attributes are [general attributes](general-attributes.md) that specify characteristics of a printer's text printing capabilities. These attributes are divided into the following groups:

[Attributes for Device Fonts](attributes-for-device-fonts.md)

[Attributes for Downloaded Fonts](attributes-for-downloaded-fonts.md)

[Attributes for Simulated Fonts](attributes-for-simulated-fonts.md)
