# MS3DPrint Standard G-Code driver


The MS3DPrint Standard G-Code driver implements a typical Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 driver for fused filament fabrication 3D printers that run with G-Code, particularly open source printers, including those from the RepRap project.

This driver receives 3MF data from the Windows spooler and outputs G-Code over a serial connection.

**Note**  The driver and the slicer it contains are still under development.
