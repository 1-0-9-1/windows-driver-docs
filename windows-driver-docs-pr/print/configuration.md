# Configuration


Schema Path:\\Printer.Configuration

Node Type:Property

The Configuration property contains information about how the device is configured: the amount of memory, whether a hard disk is installed, and whether a duplex unit is installed. This data changes only when the physical configuration of the device is modified, usually through changes in the actual hardware.

The Configuration property is the heading for all of the properties and values in the Configuration section.

The Configuration property is the parent of the following properties:

[Memory](memory.md)

[HardDisk](harddisk.md)

[DuplexUnit](duplexunit.md)
