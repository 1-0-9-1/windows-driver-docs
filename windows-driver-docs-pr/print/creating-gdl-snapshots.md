# Creating GDL Snapshots


After the GDL author creates a GDL file with the appropriate data dependencies, the client must create a snapshot by using the appropriate [configuration](gdl-configurations.md).

The following topics describe snapshots and configurations:

[Configurations for Creating Snapshots](configurations-for-creating-snapshots.md)

[Valid GDL Configurations](valid-gdl-configurations.md)

[Default GDL Configurations](default-gdl-configurations.md)

[Changing the Default GDL Configuration](changing-the-default-gdl-configuration.md)

The following topics describe two cases where exceptions need to be addressed for using configurations to generate snapshots:

[Using Invalid GDL Configurations](using-invalid-gdl-configurations.md)

[Resolving GDL Configuration Conflicts](resolving-gdl-configuration-conflicts.md)
