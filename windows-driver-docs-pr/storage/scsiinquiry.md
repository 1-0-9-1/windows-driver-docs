# ScsiInquiry


The **ScsiInquiry** method instructs the miniport driver that manages an iSCSI initiator HBA to issue a SCSI inquiry command to a logical unit on the target and return the results.

This WMI method belongs to the unpublished [MSiSCSI\_Operations WMI class](msiscsi-operations-wmi-class.md). For a description of the parameters of the **ScsiInquiry** method, see the member descriptions for the [**ScsiInquiry\_IN**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff564593) and [**ScsiInquiry\_OUT**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff564602) structures.

Miniport drivers that implement the MSiSCSI\_Operations WMI class must support **ScsiInquiry**.
