# MS\_SMHBA\_SCSIENTRY WMI Class


An HBA miniport driver that supports the Storage Management API uses the MS\_SMHBA\_SCSIENTRY class to store information that is generated by the operating system that uniquely identifies a SCSI logical unit and its adapter. This class is used to construct a binding between the operating system information and the SSP identifier for the logical unit.

The MS\_SMHBA\_SCSIENTRY class is defined as follows in *Hbaapi.mof*:

```
class MS_SMHBA_SCSIENTRY
{
    [HBAType("MS_SMHBA_PORTLUN"), WmiDataId(1)]
    MS_SMHBA_PORTLUN PortLun;

    [HBAType("HBA_LUID"), WmiDataId(2)]
    uint8  LUID[256];

    [HBAType("HBA_SCSIID"), WmiDataId(3)]
    HBAScsiID ScsiId;
};
```

When this class definition is compiled by the WMI tool suite, it produces the following data structure:

[**MS\_SMHBA\_SCSIENTRY**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563191)

There are no methods associated with this WMI class.
