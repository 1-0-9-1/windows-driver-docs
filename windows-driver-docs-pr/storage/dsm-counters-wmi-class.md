# DSM\_COUNTERS WMI Class


An MPIO driver uses the DSM\_COUNTERS WMI class to identify all timer values that are associated with a DSM.

```
class DSM_COUNTERS
{
    //
    // Flag indicating if automatic path verification must be performed every
    // N seconds (where N depends on the value set in PathVerificationPeriod).
    // Type is boolean and must be filled with either 0 (disbale) or 1 (enable).
    //
    [WmiDataId(1)] uint32 PathVerifyEnabled;

    //
    // This timer is specified in seconds. It controls the periodicity
    // for path verification.
    //
    [WmiDataId(2)] uint32 PathVerificationPeriod;

    //
    // This timer is specified in seconds. It controls the amount of time
    // that the pseudo-LUN will continue to be in memory, even after
    // loosing all its paths.
    //
    [WmiDataId(3)] uint32 PDORemovePeriod;

    //
    // The number of times a failed I/O will be retried if DsmInterpretError
    // requests a retry.
    //
    [WmiDataId(4)] uint32 RetryCount;

    //
    // This value is specified in seconds. It controls the interval of time
    // after which a failed request is retried (after the DSM has decided so).
    //
    [WmiDataId(5)] uint32 RetryInterval;

    //
    // Reserved for future use.
    //
    [WmiDataId(6)] uint32 Reserved32;
    [WmiDataId(7)] uint64 Reserved64;

};
```

When this class definition is compiled by the WMI tool suite, it produces the [**DSM\_COUNTERS**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552683) data structure. There are no methods associated with this WMI class.
