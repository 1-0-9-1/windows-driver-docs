# ClearCache


The **ClearCache** method instructs the initiator HBA to clear the iSCSI authentication and preshared key caches. This method should *not* clear any other persistent information. In particular, it should not delete persistent logons.

**ClearCache** belongs to the unpublished [MSiSCSI\_SecurityConfigOperations WMI class](msiscsi-securityconfigoperations-wmi-class.md). For a description of the parameters of the **ClearCache** method, see the member descriptions for the [**ClearCache\_OUT**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552447) structure.
