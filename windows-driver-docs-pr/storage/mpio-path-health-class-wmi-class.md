# MPIO\_PATH\_HEALTH\_CLASS WMI Class


A WMI client uses the MPIO\_PATH\_HEALTH\_CLASS WMI class to query the MPIO subsystem so that it gathers health statistics for a particular path that is associated with an MPIO disk.

```
class MPIO_PATH_HEALTH_CLASS
{
    //
    // Identifier representing the path.
    //
    [WmiDataId(1),     read,     Description("Path identifier.") : amended    ] uint64 PathId;

    //
    // Number of read requests serviced by this path.
    //
    [WmiDataId(2),     read,     Description("Number of read requests serviced by this path.") : amended
    ] uint64 NumberReads;

    //
    // Number of writes serviced by this path.
    //
    [WmiDataId(3),
     read,
     Description("Number of writes serviced by this path.") : amended
    ] uint64 NumberWrites;

    [WmiDataId(5),
     read,
     Description("Cumulative number of bytes written by requests serviced by this path.") : amended
    ] uint64 NumberBytesWritten;

    //
    // Number of requests retried using this path.

    //
    [WmiDataId(10),
     read,
     Description("Flag that indicates if the path is offline/failed") : amended
    ] boolean PathOffline;

    //
    // Count of the number of times that the NumberReads field wrapped.
    //
    [WmiDataId(11),
     read,
     Description("Count of the number of times that the NumberReads field wrapped.") : amended
    ] uint8 NumberReadsWrap;

    //
    // Count of the number of times that the NumberWrites field wrapped.
    //
    [WmiDataId(12),
     read,
     Description("Count of the number of times that the NumberWrites field wrapped.") : amended
    ] uint8 NumberWritesWrap;

    //
    // Count of the number of times that the NumberBytesRead field wrapped.

    ] uint8 NumberBytesReadWrap;

    //

    //
    [WmiDataId(14),
     read,
     Description("Count of the number of times that the NumberBytesWritten field wrapped.") : amended
    ] uint8 NumberBytesWrittenWrap;

    //
    // Number of requests sent down this path that are in flight.
    //
    [WmiDataId(15),
     read,
     Description("Number of requests sent down this path that are currently in flight.") : amended
    ] uint8 OutstandingRequests;

    //
    // Pad for data alignment.
    //
    [WmiDataId(16),

    ] uint8 Pad[2];
};
