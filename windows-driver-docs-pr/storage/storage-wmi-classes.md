## <span id="ddk_storage_wmi_classes_kr"></span><span id="DDK_STORAGE_WMI_CLASSES_KR"></span>


This section describes the Storage Management Initiative Specification (SMI-S) requirements and the system-supplied Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) classes used in the Windows storage architecture. For a discussion of how storage miniport drivers handle WMI classes, see [Handling WMI SRBs in Storage Miniport Drivers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556028).

Storage Management Providers, SMI-S requirements, and system-supplied WMI classes are in the following categories:

-   [SMI-S Requirements](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn265461)

-   [HBA WMI Classes](hba-wmi-classes.md)

-   [iSCSI WMI Classes](iscsi-wmi-classes.md)

-   [MPIO WMI Classes](mpio-wmi-classes.md)
