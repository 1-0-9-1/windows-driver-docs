# SM\_SetBindingSupport function


The SM\_SetBindingSupport method sets the binding capabilities for the indicated port.

Syntax
------

```ManagedCPlusPlus
void SM_SetBindingSupport(
   [in, HBAType("HBA_WWN")] uint8                HbaPortWWN[8],
   [in, HBAType("HBA_WWN")] uint8                DomainPortWWN[8],
   [in, HBAType("SMHBA_BIND_CAPABILITY")] uint32 Flags,
   [out, HBA_STATUS_QUALIFIERS] HBA_STATUS       HBAStatus
);
```

Parameters
----------

*HbaPortWWN*   
A worldwide name (WWN) for the port whose persistent bindings will be retrieved.

*DomainPortWWN*   
The worldwide name (WWN) for the callback. It is the Port\_Identifier that has the smallest value of any Port\_Identifier of an SMP port discovered by using the physical fibre channel port. It has a value of zero if no SMP port has been discovered by using the physical fibre channel port.

*Flags*   
A bitmap that indicates the ability of an HBA and its miniport driver to provide a specific set of features that are related to persistent binding. For a list of values that this parameter can have, see the description of the HBA\_BIND\_TYPE WMI class qualifier.

*HBAStatus*   
The status of the operation. For a list of allowed values and their descriptions, see [HBA\_STATUS](hba-status.md). The miniport driver returns this information in the HBAStatus member of a SetBindingSupport\_OUT structure.

Return value
------------

Not applicable to WMI methods.

Remarks
-------

This WMI method belongs to the MS\_SM\_TargetInformationMethods WMI Class.
