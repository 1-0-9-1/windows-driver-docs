# MSFC\_NPIVLUNMappingInformation WMI Class


A WMI client uses the MSFC\_LUNMappingInformation class to retrieve LUN to virtual port mapping information.

The MSFC\_NPIVLUNMappingInformation class is defined as follows in *Npivwmi.mof*:

```mof
class MSFC_NPIVLUNMappingInformation  
{  
    [WmiDataId(1), Description("The world wide port name of the virtual port"):Amended]  
     uint8 WWPNVirtualPort[8];  
  
    [WmiDataId(2), Description("The world wide port name of the physical port"):Amended]  
    uint8 WWPNPhysicalPort[8];  
  
    [WmiDataId(3),  
    read  
    ] uint8 OSBus;  
  
    [WmiDataId(4),  
    read  
    ] uint8 OSTarget;  
  
    [WmiDataId(5),  
    read  
    ] uint8 OSLUN;  
};  
```

When compiled by the WMI tool suite, this class definition produces the following data structure:

[**MSFC\_NPIVLUNMappingInformation**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh127626)

There are no methods associated with this WMI class.
