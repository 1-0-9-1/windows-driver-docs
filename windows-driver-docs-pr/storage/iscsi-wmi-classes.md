The iSCSI WMI classes provide the various components of the iSCSI architecture with a way to report events and transfer data.

This section includes the following main categories of iSCSI WMI classes:

-   [iSCSI WMI Common Classes](iscsi-wmi-common-classes.md)

-   [iSCSI WMI Classes That Manage Initiators, Ports, Sessions and Connections](iscsi-wmi-classes-that-manage-initiators--ports--sessions-and-connecti.md)

-   [iSCSI WMI Classes That Report Performance Statistics](iscsi-wmi-classes-that-report-performance-statistics.md)

-   [iSCSI WMI Operations Classes](iscsi-wmi-operations-classes.md)

-   [iSCSI WMI Discovery Classes](iscsi-wmi-discovery-classes.md)

-   [iSCSI WMI Network Classes](iscsi-wmi-network-classes.md)

In addition to status values that are associated with property qualifiers, there are status values that iSCSI WMI classes use that are defined in *Iscsierr.h*. The status codes that are defined in *Iscsierr.h* are described in the following topic:

-   [ISCSI\_STATUS\_QUALIFIERS](iscsi-status-qualifiers.md)
