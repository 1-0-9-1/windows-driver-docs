# ISCSI\_DiscoveredTarget2 WMI Class


The ISCSI\_DiscoveredTarget2 WMI class provides information that is related to a discovered target.

This class is similar to the [ISCSI\_DiscoveredTarget WMI class](iscsi-discoveredtarget-wmi-class.md), but ISCSI\_DiscoveredTarget2 contains target portal information that the ISCSI\_DiscoveredTarget WMI class does not have, such as the tag number for the portal group.

The ISCSI\_DiscoveredTarget2 class is unpublished and is defined in *Discover.mof*.

When the WMI tool suite compiles this class definition, it produces the [**ISCSI\_DiscoveredTarget2**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff561503) data structure.
