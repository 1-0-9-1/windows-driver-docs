# AddRADIUSServer


The **AddRADIUSServer** method adds a RADIUS server to the list of RADIUS servers that the initiator uses to establish sessions with targets. HBA initiators should store the list of RADIUS servers in nonvolatile memory.

This WMI method belongs to the unpublished [MSiSCSI\_Operations WMI class](msiscsi-operations-wmi-class.md). For a description of the parameters of the **AddRADIUSServer** method, see the member descriptions for the [**AddRADIUSServer\_IN**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550134) and [**AddRADIUSServer\_OUT**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550135) structures.
