# ISCSI\_Path WMI Class


The ISCSI\_Path WMI class contains information about the connections of an iSCSI portal. This class is defined as follows in *Mgmt.mof.*

```
class ISCSI_Path
{
    [WmiDataId(1),
     Description("iSCSI Unique connection id") : amended
    ]
    uint64 UniqueConnectionId;

    [WmiDataId(2),
     Description("Estimated speed of the connection in MegaBits Per Second") : amended
    ]
    uint64 EstimatedLinkSpeed;

    [WmiDataId(3),
     Description("Weight assigned to the path") : amended
    ]
    uint32 PathWeight;

    [WmiDataId(4),
     Description("Flag set to 1 if the path is a primary path, 0 otherwise.") : amended
    ]
    uint32 PrimaryPath;

    [WmiDataId(5),
     Description("Status of the path - connected, disconnected, reconnecting") : amended,
     Values{"Connected",
            "Disconnected",
            "Reconnecting"} : amended,
     DefineValues{"CONNECTION_STATE_CONNECTED",
                  "CONNECTION_STATE_DISCONNECTED",
                  "CONNECTION_STATE_RECONNECTING"
                 },
     ValueMap{"1", "2", "3"}
    ]
    uint32 ConnectionStatus;

    [WmiDataId(6),
     Description("Flag set to 1 if TCP offload is supported for this connection, 0 otherwise.") : amended
    ]
    uint32 TCPOffLoadAvailable;
};
```

When the WMI tool suite compiles the preceding class definition, it produces the [**ISCSI\_Path**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff561550) data structure.
