# WS-DSP Event Elements


This section describes the elements in the DSM Device schema that contain event notifications. When the status of a post-scan job changes, the DSM scan server sends the DSM device a message that contains an event element that describes the change. For more information about these event elements, see [WS-DSP Protocol Summary](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540624).

The WS-DSP schema defines the following event elements:

[PostScanJobEndStateEvent](postscanjobendstateevent.md)

[PostScanJobStatusEvent](postscanjobstatusevent.md)
