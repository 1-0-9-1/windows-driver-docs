# FileShareConfig.FileShares.ShareUNC


The **ShareUNC** element defines a single network file location that the file share processing filter will use to save the scanned images for the current post-scan job.

The DSM Scan Server will try to save the scanned images to a directory in the share contained in this element. The directory name is *user@domain* based on the submitting user for the current PostScan job.

This element has no sub-elements.
