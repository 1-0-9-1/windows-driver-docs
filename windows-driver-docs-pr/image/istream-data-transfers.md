# IStream Data Transfers


In operating systems before Windows Vista, WIA supported two transfer methods: [in-memory](in-memory-transfers.md) and [file](file-transfers.md) transfers. Beginning with Windows Vista, WIA also supports stream-based data transfers.

This section includes:

[WIA Transfer Architecture](wia-transfer-architecture.md)

[Multipage IStream Transfers](multipage-istream-transfers.md)

[Cancellation of IStream Data Transfers](cancellation-of-istream-data-transfers.md)

[Integration with the Image Processing Filter](integration-with-the-image-processing-filter.md)

[Uploading Data to a Device](uploading-data-to-a-device.md)

[Achieving Compatibility with IStream Transfers](achieving-compatibility-with-istream-transfers.md)

[WIA Transfer Constants](wia-transfer-constants.md)
