# Windows Image Acquisition Drivers


## <a href="" id="ddk-windows-image-acquisition-drivers-si"></a>


The Microsoft Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) programming interface is a Still Image (STI) architecture for the Microsoft Windows Me, Windows XP, and later platforms. This documentation explains how to develop a WIA driver that supports communication to imaging devices such as digital cameras and scanners.

WIA is a full-featured imaging architecture that has evolved from the Windows STI model. WIA provides robustness, reliability, a consistent user experience, and built-in driver support for industry standard protocols such as the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) for cameras.

See the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation for more information about the WIA API for imaging applications.
