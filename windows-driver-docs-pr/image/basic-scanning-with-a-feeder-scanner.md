# Basic Scanning with a Feeder Scanner


## <a href="" id="ddk-basic-scanning-with-a-feeder-scanner-si"></a>


A WIA application enumerates the top-level items in the scanner item tree to determine the supported features of the scanner. The application then uses the top level item as the scanning source. Flatbed scanner items are used for scanning from the flatbed, feeder items are used for scanning from the document feeder, and so on. Feeder scanners usually also have a flatbed scanning surface, so most of what applies to a flatbed scanner also applies to a feeder scanner. For additional information about basic scanning with a flatbed scanner, see [Basic Scanning for Flatbed Scanners](basic-scanning-for-flatbed-scanners.md).
