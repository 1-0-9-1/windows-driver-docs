# WS-DSD Scenario: Manage a DSM Device


An administrator would like to manage DSM Devices in an enterprise-wide environment from a control point. The administrator enters the IP address of a DSM Device into the user interface of a client application on the control point. The client application retrieves and displays the DSM Device status, scan job status, DSM Device elements, and DSM Device configuration information from the DSM Device.
