## <a href="" id="ddk-properties-and-data-management-si"></a>


WIA minidrivers define the characteristics that describe the still image device and the data that the device produces or stores. This section describes how the driver creates a logical representation of the device and its settings, the data that the device stores or produces, and the characteristics of that data.

This section contains the following topics:

[Device Properties](device-properties.md)

[Driver Items](driver-items.md)
