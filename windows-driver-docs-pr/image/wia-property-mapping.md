# WIA Property Mapping


This section covers mapping of item tree models and properties. This mapping of WIA properties from Windows XP to their Windows Vista counterparts is part of the WIA compatibility layer.

Note that Windows XP properties marked as obsolete, reserved, or to be ignored, are not mapped to Windows Vista properties.
