This section provides information about writing WIA drivers for the Microsoft Windows 64-Bit Edition for Extended Processors family of operating systems. It specifically explains how you can resolve interoperability issues with 32-bit applications that try to access 64-bit WIA minidriver user interface (UI) extensions.

This section includes:

[64-Bit WIA Driver Components](64-bit-wia-driver-components.md)
[32-Bit and 64-Bit WIA Interoperability](32-bit-and-64-bit-wia-interoperability.md)
