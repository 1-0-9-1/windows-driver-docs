# Imaging device driver design guide


This section contains information about Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) drivers, Still Image (STI) drivers, and Web Services on Devices (WSD.)

> [!NOTE]
> The WIA programming interface should be used to develop imaging drivers for Microsoft Windows Me, Windows XP, and later operating systems. The STI programming interface should only be used to develop imaging drivers for Microsoft Windows 98 and Windows 2000.
