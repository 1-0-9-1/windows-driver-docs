# WIA Properties for Segmentation Filters


## <a href="" id="ddk-wia-properties-for-segmentation-filters-si"></a>


Segmentation filters rely on several WIA properties. These include:

[**WIA\_IPS\_XPOS**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552663)

[**WIA\_IPS\_YPOS**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552671)

[**WIA\_IPS\_XEXTENT**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552661)

[**WIA\_IPS\_YEXTENT**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552669)

In Windows Vista and later, segmentation filters can make use of these two additional filter properties:

[**WIA\_IPS\_DESKEW\_Y**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552587)

[**WIA\_IPS\_DESKEW\_Y**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff552587)

The remainder of this section discusses the following additional topic:
