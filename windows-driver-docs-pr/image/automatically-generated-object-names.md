# Automatically Generated Object Names


## <a href="" id="ddk-automatically-generated-object-names-si"></a>


If the **Filename** field of the ObjectInfo dataset is blank, the Microsoft PTP WIA minidriver creates a name based on the ObjectFormat and ObjectHandle fields. For example, an image with an ObjectHandle value of 5 is called Image5 on the English version of Windows.
