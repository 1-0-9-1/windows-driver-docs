# WS-DSD Operations


The following operations are defined for WS-DSD and must be supported by conforming DSM Device implementations:

**GetActiveJobs** - returns a list of all currently active scan jobs on the DSM Device and a subset of each scan job's elements.

**GetJobElements** - returns the job elements of a particular scan job.

**GetJobHistory** - returns a list of recently completed scan jobs on the DSM Device and a subset of the job elements of each scan job.

**GetScannerElements** - requests information about the DSM Device.

**ValidateScanTicket** - validates a scan ticket on the DSM Device to ensure the settings in the scan ticket will work in a future scan job.
