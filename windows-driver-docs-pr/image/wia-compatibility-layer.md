# WIA Compatibility Layer


The WIA compatibility layer allows the use of legacy applications and devices with Windows Vista.

There are two functions of the WIA compatibility layer:

1.  Mapping of different item tree architectures and properties between legacy applications and Windows Vista drivers and Windows Vista applications and legacy drivers.

2.  Mapping between the Windows Vista, stream-based data transfer model and the legacy TYMED-based model.

This section contains information on the following topics:

[WIA Property Mapping](wia-property-mapping.md)

[WIA Compatibility Layer Data Transfers](wia-compatibility-layer-data-transfers.md)
