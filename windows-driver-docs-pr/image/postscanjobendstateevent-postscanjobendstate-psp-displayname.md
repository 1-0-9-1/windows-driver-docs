# PostScanJobEndStateEvent.PostScanJobEndState.PSP\_DisplayName


The **PSP\_DisplayName** element contains the user-interface display name of a scan process.

To enable a user to select a scan process from a list of available scan processes, the user interface of a DSM device displays the names of the scan processes. When an IT administrator uses the scan-management console (SMC) to define a scan process, the administrator assigns a user-interface display name to the scan process.

This element has no sub-elements.
