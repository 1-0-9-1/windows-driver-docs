# Active Directory


The DSM device must interact with Active Directory as follows:

-   By retrieving domain-specific credentials from a user (for example, from a card reader attached to the DSM device) and sending them to Active Directory.

-   By querying for and retrieving a user object (specifically the user SID) from Active Directory.

-   By querying for and retrieving the list of Scan Processes available to the user from the Active Directory.

-   By retrieving the details of a selected Scan Process from the Active Directory.
