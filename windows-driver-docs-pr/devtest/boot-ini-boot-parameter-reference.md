# Boot.ini Boot Parameter Reference


*Boot entry parameters*, or *boot parameters*, are optional, system-specific switches that represent configuration options. You can add boot parameters to a boot entry for an operating system.

This section describes the boot parameters for Windows Server 2003 and earlier versions of Windows NT-based operating systems that are related to developing, testing, and debugging drivers on computers with x86-based, x64-based, and Itanium-based processors. You can add these parameters to the boot entries for Windows operating systems.

### Comments

Unless stated otherwise, the boot parameters in this reference are valid on boot entries for all systems that run on Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Windows 2000. These boot parameters do not work on Windows Vista and later versions of Windows.

This document describes boot parameters that are of special interest to driver developers and testers. For a complete list of the Boot.ini file parameters, see [Available Switch Options for the Windows XP and the Windows Server 2003 Boot.ini Files](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=137742) topic in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.
