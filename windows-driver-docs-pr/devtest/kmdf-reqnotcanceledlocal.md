# ReqNotCanceledLocal rule (kmdf)


The **ReqNotCanceledLocal** rule specifies that if a request marked as cancelable is completed in a default I/O queue callback function, the [**WdfRequestUnmarkCancelable**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550035) method must be called on the I/O request before completion. The I/O request must be completed, unless the request is canceled before it calls **WdfRequestUnmarkCancelable**.

If a request that was marked as cancelable by [**WdfRequestMarkCancelable**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549983) is completed (by calling [**WdfRequestComplete**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549945), [**WdfRequestCompleteWithInformation**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549948), or [**WdfRequestCompleteWithPriorityBoost**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549949)), the [**WdfRequestUnmarkCancelable**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550035) method must be called before the I/O request is completed. The request can be completed unless the **WdfRequestUnmarkCancelable** method returns status that is equal to **STATUS\_CANCELLED**.

The default I/O queue callback functions for a request are [*EvtIoDefault*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff541757), [*EvtIoRead*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff541776), [*EvtIoWrite*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff541813), [*EvtIoDeviceControl*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff541758), [*EvtIoInternalDeviceControl*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff541768).
