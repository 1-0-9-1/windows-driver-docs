# IrqlKeReleaseSpinLock rule (wdm)


The **IrqlKeReleaseSpinLock** rule specifies that the driver calls [**KeReleaseSpinLock**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553145) only when it is executing at IRQLÂ =Â DISPATCH\_LEVEL.

This rule also specifies that the value of the *NewIrql* parameter in the call to **KeReleaseSpinLock** is equal to the IRQL at which the driver was executing before the call to [**KeAcquireSpinLock**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551917). (This value is also the value of the *OldIrql* parameter that is supplied by **KeAcquireSpinLock**.)
