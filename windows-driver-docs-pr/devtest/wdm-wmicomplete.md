# WmiComplete rule (wdm)


The **WmiComplete** rule specifies that when processing a [**WMI minor IRP**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566361), the driver calls [**IoCompleteRequest**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548343) before returning from the [**DispatchSystemControl**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543412) routine.

A *WMI minor IRP* is an [**IRP\_MJ\_SYSTEM\_CONTROL**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550813) request with a WMI minor function code.

For more information about processing WMI minor IRPs, see [**WMI Requirements for WDM Drivers**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566370), [**Handling WMI Requests**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff546968), [**Windows Management Instrumentation Routines**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff565794), and [**WMI Library Support Routines**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff566359).

Drivers that are not registered as WMI data providers must forward the WMI request to the next lower driver. To verify this action, use the [**WmiForward**](wdm-wmiforward.md) rule.
