# Cannot load regression data


Because of an internal error, SDV did not create the defect.txt file, a file that it requires for the Static Driver Verifier Report. As a result, it cannot display the report.

To resolve this error, uninstall and reinstall SDV, and then rerun the verification, including any preliminary steps, such as [Scanning the Driver](scanning-the-driver.md) and [processing any libraries](library-processing-in-static-driver-verifier.md) that the driver requires.
