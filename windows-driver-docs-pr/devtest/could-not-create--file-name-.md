# Could not create &lt;file name&gt;


SDV reports this error when it cannot create a required internal file.

Confirm that you have permission to create, edit, and delete files in the driver's sources directory and in the \\tools\\sdv subdirectories of the WDK. These permissions are required to run SDV.
