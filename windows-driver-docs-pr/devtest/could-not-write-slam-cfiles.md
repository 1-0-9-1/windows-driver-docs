# Could not write SLAM\_CFILES


SDV reports this error in the compile step when it cannot create a required internal file.

Verify that you have permission to read, edit, and delete files in the driver's sources directory and in the \\tools\\sdv subdirectories of the WDK.

If you do, this message might indicate a problem with SDV. To resolve this error, uninstall and reinstall SDV.
