# SyncReqSend rule (kmdf)


The **SyncReqSend** rule specifies that all synchronous send requests are done by using synchronous-specific KMDF device driver interface methods, and that the methods have a nonzero timeout value set.

If the driver calls a *WDFxxxSendXXXSynchronously* method without setting a valid timeout, the thread can become stalled if hardware does not respond promptly.
