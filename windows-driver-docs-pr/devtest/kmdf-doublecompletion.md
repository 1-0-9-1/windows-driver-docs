# DoubleCompletion rule (kmdf)


The **DoubleCompletion** rule specifies that drivers must not complete an I/O request twice. The following methods should not be called twice in a row for the same request: [**WdfRequestComplete**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549945), [**WdfRequestCompleteWithInformation**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549948), [**WdfRequestCompleteWithPriorityBoost**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549949).

The difference between this rule and the [DoubleCompletionLocal](kmdf-doublecompletionlocal.md) rule is that the DoubleCompletionLocal rule is only performed within the default I/O queue callback functions.
