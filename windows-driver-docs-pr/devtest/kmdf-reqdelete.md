# ReqDelete rule (kmdf)


The **ReqDelete** rule specifies that driver-created requests are not passed to *WdfRequestCompleteXxx* functions. Instead, the request should be deleted upon completion.

If the driver creates a framework request object in a call to [**WdfRequestCreate**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549951), the request should be deleted by using [**WdfObjectDelete**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff548734) when the driver is finished with the request.

The driver cannot call [**WdfRequestComplete**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549945), [**WdfRequestCompleteWithInformation**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549948) or [**WdfRequestCompleteWithPriorityBoost**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549949) functions on the request object. The *WdfRequestCompleteXxx* functions are reserved for framework-supplied requests.
