# This is not a valid driver or library folder


SDV displays this message when you attempt to run an SDV command in the directory that contains the project file, but the project file does not indicate that it is a driver or driver library.

For information about libraries, see [Library Processing in Static Driver Verifier](library-processing-in-static-driver-verifier.md).
