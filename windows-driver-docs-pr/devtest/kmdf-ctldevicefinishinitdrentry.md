# CtlDeviceFinishInitDrEntry rule (kmdf)


The CtlDeviceFinishInitDrEntry rule specifies that if a driver creates a control device object in a [**DriverEntry**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff540807) callback function, it must call [**WdfControlFinishInitializing**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff545854) after the device has been created and before it exits from the [*EvtDriverDeviceAdd*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff541693) callback function. This rule does not apply for non-PnP drivers.
