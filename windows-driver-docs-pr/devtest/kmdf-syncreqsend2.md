# SyncReqSend2 rule (kmdf)


The **SyncReqSend2** rule specifies that synchronous request sends have a nonzero time-out value set.

If the driver calls [**WdfRequestSend**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550027) without setting a valid time-out in the request options, the thread can be stalled if hardware does not respond promptly.
