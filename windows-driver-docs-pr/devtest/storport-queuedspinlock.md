# QueuedSpinLock rule (storport)


The **QueuedSpinLock** rule verifies that in-stack queued spin locks that are acquired using [**KeAcquireInStackQueuedSpinLock**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551899) are promptly released using [**KeReleaseInStackQueuedSpinLock**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553130). In addition, at the end of a dispatch or cancel routine, the driver should not hold any locks.
