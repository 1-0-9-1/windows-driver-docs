# DoubleCompleteWorkItem rule (ndis)


The DoubleCompleteWorkItem rule specifies that NDIS drivers must not complete an OID request multiple times when the completion is deferred in a work item.

This rule tracks the OID and verifies that when the driver queues a work item, the driver does not call **NdisMOidRequestComplete** multiple times on the same OID.
