# DoubleCompletionLocal rule (kmdf)


The DoubleCompletionLocal rule specifies that drivers must not complete an I/O request twice.

The following methods should not be called twice in a row for the same request:

[**WdfRequestComplete**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549945)

[**WdfRequestCompleteWithInformation**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549948)

[**WdfRequestCompleteWithPriorityBoost**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff549949)

The difference between this rule and the [DoubleCompletion](wdm-doublecompletion.md) rule is that this rule is only performed within the default I/O queue callback functions.
