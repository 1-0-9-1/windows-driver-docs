# SpinLockDpr rule (ndis)


The **SpinLockDpr** rule verifies the correct use of the NDIS spin lock interface.

This rule specifies that calls to [**NdisDprAcquireSpinLock**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff561749) are made only when the spin lock is in the unlocked state. This rule also verifies that the spin lock is released before the miniport handler routine exits.
