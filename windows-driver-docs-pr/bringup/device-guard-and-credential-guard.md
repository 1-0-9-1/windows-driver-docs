# Device Guard and Credential Guard


Device Guard is one of Windows security features, that is a combination of enterprise-related hardware, firmware and software security features. When configured together, will lock a device down so that it can only run trusted applications.

Credential Guard uses virtualization-based security to isolate secrets so that only privileged system software can access them.

Device Guard and Credential Guard are optional features, that when implemented and enabled, reduce the available attack surface by requiring additional protectors.
