### SMBIOS


SMBIOS specification defines data structures and information that will go into the data structures pertinent to a system. By using the latest SMBIOS Specification, we keep up with the latest changes defined in the specification. There is a table below describing the recommended SMBIOS settings along with guidance on what type of information should be in these fields. Having these fields populated with data pertaining to each individual system allows system administrators the ability to remotely identify and manage these systems. Computer Hardware IDs (CHIDs) are generated using the values from this table, and care and thought should be given to setting these.

To add uniformity to SMBIOS to better identify device information, Microsoft recommends the following as guidance when populating SMBIOS fields. The below SMBIOS data is also collected and/or used in various capacities. The data going into these fields should be planned in detail before populating using tools provided by BIOS/Firmware vendors. The hash generated for CHID targeting is based off data populating these fields.

Though this table is similarly listed in the "Windows 10 Driver Publishing Workflow" document on MSDN, this document prescribes level of detail that should also go into some of the fields helping to increase the level of specificity.

| "Manufacturer"      | System Information (Type 1)    | String    | 04h        | 32         | Contoso, Inc. manufactures 2 product lines: 1) "A" series, and 2) "B" series. The "A" series of devices include the Contoso "A11" and "A13" device sub-brands, each of which have different screen sizes and both support physically detachable keyboards (though the keyboards are sold as an option). The "A11" has three models: 1) the base model (the a110001) 2) a midsize model with a premium audio package (the a110002) and 3) a high-end model with a higher resolution touch panel (the a110003). Each model has gone through several generations of baseboard revisions, which are identified internally with codes bb01 through bb04. Each of the "A11" models can be further customized with different storage and memory configurations. To separate different production runs on their manufacturing floor, Contoso uses an internal identification system that combines the Family, Product Name, market region, and production run number. | "Contoso"                                                                                                                |

                       This text string identifies the family to which a computer belongs. A family refers to a set of computers that are similar but not identical from a hardware or software point of view. Typically, a family is composed of different computer models, which have different configurations and pricing points. Computers in the same family often have similar branding and cosmetic features.  | The value in the "family" field identifies Company’s sub-brand name, specific to a grouping of similar devices know as a product line, under which the device is marketed to End Users. The "family" value excludes variance by components, device generation, manufactured year, SKU, or other factors. The "family" value is generally not specific enough to indicate an actual device, but rather product line marketed to End Users. | The format of the "family" field string is to match what End Users identify as Company’s sub-brand name, specific to a product line. The "family" field string should not contain the "manufacturer" name.                                                          | The "family" field is the second-level indicator to End Users, representing a grouping of similar devices know as a product line.

| "Product Name"      | Number of null-terminated string.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | The value in the "product name" field identifies Company’s specific model of device, without enumerating configuration variance. (e.g. processor, memory, & storage variance) There are often several "product names" that are specific to model in a specific "family", although generally no more than a dozen or so.                                                                                                                   | The format of the "product name" field string is to match what End Users see as the device model name or identifier value. The recommendation is to include the full value of the Family field followed by a single space and then the model name/identifier value. | The "product name" field is the third-level indicator to End Users, representing the specific model of device. A "product name" may last for the lifetime of the "family", through multiple revisions or generations of the hardware where hardware revisions are not marketed as a new product to End Users. |
| "Baseboard Product" | Number of null-terminated string.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | The value in the "baseboard product" field identifies the baseboard and should accurately reflect variances in baseboards across different devices in the same "family" and "product name". This value must change when the baseboard in the device model changes and it may be used as an asset identifier for servicing.                                                                                                                | The format of the "baseboard product" field string can be set by Company, and it does not need to align to End User marketing information.                                                                                                                          | The "baseboard product" field is the fourth-level indicator of devices to Company and is not marketed to End Users.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
