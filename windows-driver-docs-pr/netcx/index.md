# Network Adapter WDF Class Extension (Cx)


[!include[NetAdapterCx Beta Prerelease](../netcx-beta-prerelease.md)]

Starting in WindowsÂ 10, version 1703, the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) includes a class extension module (NetAdapterCx) that enables you to write a KMDF-based driver (called the client driver in this section) for a network adapter.
In previous versions of Windows, you needed to write an NDIS miniport driver.

To learn how to port an NDIS 6.x miniport driver into a Windows Driver Framework (WDF) networking client miniport driver, see [Porting NDIS Miniport Drivers to NetAdapter Class Extension](porting-ndis-to-netadapter-cx.md).
