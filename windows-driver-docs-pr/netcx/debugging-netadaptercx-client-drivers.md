# Debugging NetAdapterCx Client Drivers

You can use [Windows Driver Framework Extensions (Wdfkd.dll)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551876) commands to debug your client driver.  In addition, you can provide a NETADAPTER handle to !ndiskd.netadapter to see networking-specific properties of your driver.
