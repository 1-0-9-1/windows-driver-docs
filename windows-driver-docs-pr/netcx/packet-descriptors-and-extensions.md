# Packet descriptors and extensions

This topic introduces concepts underlying packet descriptors and extensions in NetAdapterCx 1.2 and later.

## Overview

*Packet descriptors* are small, runtime-extensible structures that describe a network packet. They can be used by different components in the system and are not limited in scope to specific APIs or header files. Each packet has one core descriptor that is used to hold OS-specific information.

*Packet extensions* are attached to each packet's core descriptor and are used by client drivers to hold per-packet metadata to share with the upper layers. Extensions can hold offload information for checksum, large send offload (LSO), and receive segment coalescence (RSC), or they can also hold application-specific details.

## Packet descriptor and extension design and benefits

Packet descriptors used by NetAdapterCx 1.2 and later are designed for high scalability and provide the follwing benefits.

### Extensibility

Extensibility is a core feature of the NetAdapterCx packet descriptor, as it also affects versionability and performance. At runtime, a client driver can allocate a context block on all packet descriptors in a collection (in other words, on a datapath queue). This enables the operating system to allocate all descriptors with pre-allocated extensions inline with the descriptor. Each extension block is appended to a core descriptor, as shown in the following figure:

![NetAdapterCx packet descriptor layout](images/packet-descriptors-1-layout.png)

Drivers are not permitted to hardcode the offset to any extension block â€“ instead, they must query at runtime for the offset to any particular extension. For example, a driver might query the offset to Extension B, and get back 70 bytes like in the following figure:

![Querying the offset to an extension of the core packet descriptor](images/packet-descriptors-2-offset-query.png)

Once a descriptor is created, all its offsets are guaranteed by the OS to be constant, so drivers don't have to re-query offsets often. 

Extensions are named with a string and a version number, and can be created by a client driver. For example, an IHV might insert an extension for custom Quality of Service (QoS) features and query the offset to that extension in a value-add protocol driver.

Because extensions are pre-allocated by the OS in an array at the time the datapath queue is initialized, there is no need for runtime allocation of blocks, searching a list for a specific descriptor, or having to store pointers to every packet extension.

### Versionability

NetAdapterCx's packet descriptor can be easily versioned by adding new fields to the end, such as in the following figure:

![NetAdapterCx core packet descriptor versioning](images/packet-descriptors-3-core-descriptor-versioning.png)

Drivers that know about the V2 fields can access them, while V1 drivers will use extension offsets to skip over the V2 fields so they can access the fields they do understand. In addition, each extension can be versioned in the same way, as the following figure shows:

![NetAdapterCx packet extension versioning](images/packet-descriptors-4-extension-versioning.png)

A driver that understands the new extension can use it. Other drivers can skip over the new fields. This permits different parts of the packet descriptor to be versioned independently.

### Performance

NetAdapterCx client drivers can target network interface cards (NICs) that are capabable of hundreds of gigabits per second (Gbps), with thousands of RSS queues. The extensibility model outlined previously provides benefits to help meet these performance goals:

1. Extensions are allocated at queue creation time, so drivers don't have to allocate and deallocate memory in the active data path or deal with lookaside lists of context blocks.
2. Extensions are in-line, which improves CPU cache hits.
3. There is no need for pointers, which saves space.
4. Features that aren't used occupy 0 bytes of space.

## Registering packet extensions

The first step in working with packet extensions in your NIC client driver is to declare and register them in your *[EvtNetAdapterSetCapabilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/netadapter/nc-netadapter-evt_net_adapter_set_capabilities)* callback function. You might do so like in the following example. Note that the example leaves out error handling for clarity.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This example calls the **NetAdapterRegisterPacketExtension** method, which is available in the *NetPacketExtensionP.h* header from the [Realtek Github sample driver](https://github.com/Microsoft/NetAdapter-Cx-Driver-Samples/tree/master/RtEthSample). Because this header is prereleased product, it may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the contents of this header.

```
NTSTATUS
MyAdapterSetCapabilities(
    NETADAPTER Adapter
)
{
    NTSTATUS status = STATUS_SUCCESS;

    // Set various capabilities such as link layer MTU size, link layer capabilities, power capabilities,
    // and datapath capabilities
    ...   

    // Register the checksum extension
    NET_PACKET_EXTENSION extension;
    NET_PACKET_EXTENSION_INIT(
        &extension,
        NET_PACKET_EXTENSION_CHECKSUM_NAME,
        NET_PACKET_EXTENSION_CHECKSUM_VERSION_1,
        NET_PACKET_EXTENSION_CHECKSUM_VERSION_1_SIZE,
        sizeof(ULONG) - 1);

    status = NetAdapterRegisterPacketExtension(netAdapter, &extension);

    // Register the LSO extension
    NET_PACKET_EXTENSION_INIT(
        &extension,
        NET_PACKET_EXTENSION_LSO_NAME,
        NET_PACKET_EXTENSION_LSO_VERSION_1,
        NET_PACKET_EXTENSION_LSO_VERSION_1_SIZE,
        sizeof(ULONG) - 1);

    status = NetAdapterRegisterPacketExtension(netAdapter, &extension);

    // Set other needed capabilities
    ...
}
```

## Querying packet extension offsets for datapath queues

After registering packet extensions during *EvtNetAdapterSetCapabilities*, you'll need the extension offsets to access each one as you process your packets. To reduce calls out of your driver and improve performance, you can query the offsets for your extensions during the *EvtNetAdapterCreateTx(Rx)Queue* callback function and store the offset information in your queue context. Here is an example for a transmit queue. This example is similar to the example on *[EvtNetAdapterCreateTxQueue](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/netadapter/nc-netadapter-evt_net_adapter_create_txqueue)* but focuses only on packet extensions.

```C++
NTSTATUS
MyAdapterCreateTxQueue(
    _In_    NETADAPTER netAdapter,
    _Inout_ PNETTXQUEUE_INIT txQueueInit)
{
    NTSTATUS status = STATUS_SUCCESS;

    // Prepare the configuration structure
    NET_TXQUEUE_CONFIG txConfig;
    NET_TXQUEUE_CONFIG_INIT(
        &txConfig,
        EvtTxQueueAdvance,
        EvtTxQueueSetNotificationEnabled,
        EvtTxQueueCancel);

    // Configure other Tx queue properties such as packet contexts
    ...

    // Create the transmit queue
    NETTXQUEUE txQueue;
    status = NetTxQueueCreate(
        txQueueInit,
        &txAttributes,
        &txConfig,
        &txQueue);

    // Get the queue context for storing the queue ID and packet extension offset info
    PMY_TX_QUEUE_CONTEXT queueContext = GetMyTxQueueContext(txQueue);

    // Query checksum packet extension offset and store it in the context
    NET_PACKET_EXTENSION_QUERY extension;
    NET_PACKET_EXTENSION_QUERY_INIT(
        &extension,
        NET_PACKET_EXTENSION_CHECKSUM_NAME,
        NET_PACKET_EXTENSION_CHECKSUM_VERSION_1);

    queueContext->ChecksumExtensionOffset = NetTxQueueGetPacketExtensionOffset(txQueue, &extension);

    // Query Large Send Offload packet extension offset and store it in the context
    NET_PACKET_EXTENSION_QUERY_INIT(
        &extension,
        NET_PACKET_EXTENSION_LSO_NAME,
        NET_PACKET_EXTENSION_LSO_VERSION_1);
    
    queueContext->LsoExtensionOffset = NetTxQueueGetPacketExtensionOffset(txQueue, &extension);

    return status;
}
```

## Getting packet extensions at runtime

Once you have stored extension offsets in your queue context, you can use them any time you need information in an extension. For example, you could call the [NetPacketGetPacketChecksum](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/netpacket/nf-netpacket-netpacketgetpacketchecksum) method while you program descriptors to hardware:

```C++
    // Get the extension offset from the device context
    PMY_TX_QUEUE_CONTEXT queueContext = GetMyTxQueueContext(txQueue);
    size_t checksumOffset = queueContext->ChecksumExtensionOffset;

    // Get the checksum info for this packet
    NET_PACKET_CHECKSUM* checksumInfo = NetPacketGetChecksum(packet, checksumOffset);

    // Do work with the checksum info
    if(checksumInfo->Layer4 == NET_PACKET_TX_CHECKSUM_REQUIRED)
    {
        ...
    }
```

## Packet extension constants and helper methods

To help with common packet extension operations, NetAdapterCx provides definitions for known packet extensions constants.

| Constant | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| NET_PACKET_EXTENSION_INVALID_OFFSET | Guards against invalid offset sizes. |
| <ul><li>NET_PACKET_EXTENSION_CHECKSUM_NAME</li><li>NET_PACKET_EXTENSION_CHECKSUM_VERSION_1</li><li>NET_PACKET_EXTENSION_CHECKSUM_VERSION_1_SIZE</li></ul> | The name, version, and size of the checksum packet extension. |
| <ul><li>NET_PACKET_EXTENSION_LSO_NAME</li><li>NET_PACKET_EXTENSION_LSO_VERSION_1</li><li>NET_PACKET_EXTENSION_LSO_VERSION_1_SIZE</li></ul> | The name, version, and size of the large send offload (LSO) packet extension. |
| <ul><li>NET_PACKET_EXTENSION_RSC_NAME</li><li>NET_PACKET_EXTENSION_RSC_VERSION_1</li><li>NET_PACKET_EXTENSION_RSC_VERSION_1_SIZE</li></ul> | The name, version, and size of the receive segment coalescence (RSC) packet extension. |

Additionally, NetAdapterCx provides three helper methods that act as wrappers around the [NetPacketGetExtension](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/netpacket/nf-netpacket-netpacketgetextension) method. Each of these methods returns a pointer to the appropriate type of structure.
