# Hardware access for Universal Windows Platform apps

## Overview
The extensibility of the Windows platform has led to the creation of a
diverse ecosystem of device builders where innovative differentiation is
key to success for these device manufacturers, which enables unique
hardware and software experiences. [Universal Windows Platform
(UWP)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/universal-application-platform-guide)
applications create a broad range of scenarios such as to control
hardware device settings and provide a diverse app platform available on
any device running Windows 10.

Device and System vendors often provide their users with applications
that allow them to have some control over the functionality of their
hardware; previously apps with such functionality were not made as UWP
apps as they were unable to get access to system software from the app
container. They would come pre-installed or become installed with a
driver by a Windows Update or as an installation downloaded from the
internet. A problem would be that these applications couldnâ€™t update
outside of an updater app, often required a co-installer, and could very
easily get out of sync.
