# Extensible Station Authentication Operations


**Important**  The [Native 802.11 Wireless LAN](native-802-11-wireless-lan4.md) interface is deprecated in Windows 10 and later. Please use the WLAN Device Driver Interface (WDI) instead. For more information about WDI, see [WLAN Universal Windows driver model](wifi-universal-driver-model.md).

 

The following topics describe the authentication operations performed by the Native 802.11 miniport driver operating in Extensible Station (ExtSTA) mode:
