# Receive Side Scaling


## <a href="" id="ddk-ndis-receive-side-scaling-ng"></a>


Receive side scaling (RSS) improves the system performance related to handling of network data on multiprocessor systems.

For introductory information about RSS, see [Introduction to Receive Side Scaling](introduction-to-receive-side-scaling.md).

The following topics describe the RSS implementations that are possible with different levels of hardware and software support:

[Non-RSS Receive Processing](non-rss-receive-processing.md)

[RSS with a Single Hardware Receive Queue](rss-with-a-single-hardware-receive-queue.md)

[RSS with Hardware Queuing](rss-with-hardware-queuing.md)

[RSS with Message Signaled Interrupts](rss-with-message-signaled-interrupts.md)

The following topics provide additional information about RSS:
