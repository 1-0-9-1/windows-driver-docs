# Native 802.11 Miniport Drivers


**Important**  The [Native 802.11 Wireless LAN](native-802-11-wireless-lan4.md) interface is deprecated in Windows 10 and later. Please use the WLAN Device Driver Interface (WDI) instead. For more information about WDI, see [WLAN Universal Windows driver model](wifi-universal-driver-model.md).

 

This section describes Native 802.11 miniport drivers for wireless LAN (WLAN) devices. These drivers provide a network interface over the WLAN media for both infrastructure and independent basic service set (IBSS) networks.

**Note**  IBSS (Ad hoc) and SoftAP are deprecated. Starting with Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2, use [Wi-Fi Direct](wi-fi-direct-miniport-initialization-and-configuration.md).
