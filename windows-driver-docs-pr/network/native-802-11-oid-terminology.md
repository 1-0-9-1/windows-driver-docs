# Native 802.11 OID terminology

>[!IMPORTANT]
> The [Native 802.11 Wireless LAN](native-802-11-wireless-lan4.md) interface is deprecated in WindowsÂ 10 and later. Please use the WLAN Device Driver Interface (WDI) instead. For more information about WDI, see [WLAN Universal Windows driver model](wifi-universal-driver-model.md).

The Native 802.11 OID documentation uses the following terms to indicate functionality implemented by the wireless LAN (WLAN) software and hardware:

| Term | Meaning | 
| --- | --- |
| Miniport driver | Functionality implemented by miniport driver only |
| Network interface card (NIC) | Functionality implemented by NIC hardware only |
| 802.11 Station | Functionality implemented by miniport driver or NIC firmware/hardware |

The Native 802.11 interface defines scalar data types using the following reverse-Hungarian notation:

| Prefix | Data type | 
| --- | --- |
| b | BOOLEAN |
| u | ULONG |
| us | USHORT |
| uc | UCHAR |
| ull | ULONGLONG |
