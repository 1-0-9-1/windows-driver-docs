# Miniport Driver Scatter/Gather DMA


## <a href="" id="ddk-scatter-gather-dma-ng"></a>


If an NDIS 6.0 miniport driver manages a NIC that supports bus-master DMA, the driver registers NDIS scatter/gather DMA (SGDMA) resources and manages scatter/gather lists.

The following topics provide information about managing NDIS SGDMA resources and scatter/gather lists:

-   [Registering and Deregistering DMA Channels](registering-and-deregistering-dma-channels.md)
-   [Allocating and Freeing Scatter/Gather Lists](allocating-and-freeing-scatter-gather-lists.md)
