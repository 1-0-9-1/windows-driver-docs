# Extensible Station Cipher Operations


**Important**  The [Native 802.11 Wireless LAN](native-802-11-wireless-lan4.md) interface is deprecated in Windows 10 and later. Please use the WLAN Device Driver Interface (WDI) instead. For more information about WDI, see [WLAN Universal Windows driver model](wifi-universal-driver-model.md).

 

The following topics describe the cipher operations performed by the Native 802.11 miniport driver operating in Extensible Station (ExtSTA) mode:

[Extensible Station Requirements for Cipher Key Types](extensible-station-requirements-for-cipher-key-types.md)

[Querying Supported Cipher Algorithms](querying-supported-cipher-algorithms.md)

[Enabling Cipher Algorithms](enabling-cipher-algorithms.md)

[Specifying Cipher Keys](specifying-cipher-keys.md)
