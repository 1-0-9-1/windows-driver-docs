# OID\_DOT11\_WFD\_ADDITIONAL\_IE


**Important**  The [Native 802.11 Wireless LAN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560690) interface is deprecated in Windows 10 and later. Please use the WLAN Device Driver Interface (WDI) instead. For more information about WDI, see [WLAN Universal Windows driver model](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn897672).

 

When set, the OID\_DOT11\_WFD\_ADDITIONAL\_IE object identifier (OID) is sent to the miniport to add Informational Elements (IEs) to probe responses and beacons. Additional IEs are also sent with this OID for inclusion in the probe requests generated by the miniport driver.

The data type for OID\_DOT11\_WFD\_ADDITIONAL\_IE is the [**DOT11\_WFD\_ADDITIONAL\_IE**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh464144) structure.

When the Wi-Fi Direct (WFD) port is operating in device mode, the IEs are only added to probe requests and responses. When the WFD port is operating in Group Owner (GO) mode, the IEs are also added to the beacons.
