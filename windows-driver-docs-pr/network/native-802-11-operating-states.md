# Native 802.11 Operating States


**Important**  The [Native 802.11 Wireless LAN](native-802-11-wireless-lan4.md) interface is deprecated in Windows 10 and later. Please use the WLAN Device Driver Interface (WDI) instead. For more information about WDI, see [WLAN Universal Windows driver model](wifi-universal-driver-model.md).

 

Each Native 802.11 operation mode consists of various states that define the actions the miniport driver can perform while operating in a particular mode. The following topics describe the operating states of each Native 802.11 operation mode:

[Extensible Access Point (ExtAP) Operating States](extensible-access-point-operating-states.md)

[Extensible Station (ExtSTA) Operating States](extensible-station-operating-states.md)

[Network Monitor (NetMon) Operating States](network-monitor-operating-states.md)
