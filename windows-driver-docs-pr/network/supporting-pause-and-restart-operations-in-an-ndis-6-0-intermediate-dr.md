# Supporting Pause and Restart Operations in an NDIS 6.0 Intermediate Driver


## <a href="" id="ddk-supporting-pause-and-restart-operations-in-an-ndis-6-0-intermediat"></a>


All NDIS 6.0 intermediate drivers must support pause and restart operations. Unless noted otherwise, miniport driver and protocol driver pause and restart operations apply to intermediate drivers. For general information about pause and restart operations, see [Driver Stack Management](driver-stack-management.md).

For more information about pause and restart of the miniport upper edge of an intermediate driver, see [Supporting NDIS 6.0 Miniport Adapter Pause and Restart Operations](supporting-ndis-6-0-miniport-adapter-pause-and-restart-operations.md).

For more information about pause and restart of the protocol lower edge of an intermediate driver, see [Supporting NDIS 6.0 Protocol Binding Pause and Restart Operations](supporting-ndis-6-0-protocol-binding-pause-and-restart-operations.md).
