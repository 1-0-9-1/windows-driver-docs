# 802.11 Cipher Algorithms


**Important**  The [Native 802.11 Wireless LAN](native-802-11-wireless-lan4.md) interface is deprecated in Windows 10 and later. Please use the WLAN Device Driver Interface (WDI) instead. For more information about WDI, see [WLAN Universal Windows driver model](wifi-universal-driver-model.md).

 

The following topics describe the standard 802.11 cipher algorithms that a Native 802.11 miniport driver can support:

[WEP](wep.md)

[TKIP](tkip.md)

[AES-CCMP](aes-ccmp.md)

In addition, a miniport driver, operating in Extensible Station (ExtSTA) mode, can support proprietary or non-standard cipher algorithms. For more information about how these cipher algorithms are supported, see [Extending Support for 802.11 Authentication Algorithms](extending-support-for-802-11-authentication-algorithms.md).
