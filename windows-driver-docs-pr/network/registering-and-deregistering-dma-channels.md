# Registering and Deregistering DMA Channels





An NDIS miniport driver calls the [**NdisMRegisterScatterGatherDma**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563659) function from its [*MiniportInitializeEx*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559389) function to register a DMA channel with NDIS.

The miniport driver passes a DMA description to [**NdisMRegisterScatterGatherDma**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563659) in the *DmaDescription* parameter. **NdisMRegisterScatterGatherDma** returns a size for the buffer that should be large enough to hold the scatter/gather list. Miniport drivers should use this size to preallocate the storage for scatter/gather lists.

The miniport driver also passes [**NdisMRegisterScatterGatherDma**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563659) the entry points for the *MiniportXxx* functions that NDIS calls to process the scatter/gather list. NDIS calls the miniport driver's [*MiniportProcessSGList*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559420) function after HAL has built the scatter/gather list for a buffer. **NdisMRegisterScatterGatherDma** supplies a handle in the *pNdisMiniportDmaHandle* parameter, which the miniport driver must use in subsequent calls to NDIS scatter/gather DMA functions.

An NDIS miniport driver calls the [**NdisMDeregisterScatterGatherDma**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563581) function from its [*MiniportHaltEx*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff559388) function to release scatter/gather DMA resources.
