# Using Xperf with USB ETW


This topic describes how to use Xperf with Netmon to analyze USB trace data.

You can use Xperf with Netmon to analyze trace data or to analyze kernel events on the same timeline as a USB trace. Xperf is in the Windows Performance Toolkit, which is part of the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows 8. You can download the SDK from [this Web site](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/hardware/hh852363).
