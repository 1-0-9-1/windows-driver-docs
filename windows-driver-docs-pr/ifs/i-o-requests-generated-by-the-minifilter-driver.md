# I/O Requests Generated by the Minifilter Driver


A minifilter driver can generate and send IRP-based I/O requests from one of the minifilter driver's own instances on the current volume or on another volume. The generated I/O is seen only by the minifilter driver instances and legacy filter drivers attached below the specified instance, and by the file system. This solves many problems related to recursive I/O in the legacy filter driver model, in which I/O requests generated by a legacy filter driver must travel through the entire file system stack, starting with the topmost driver.

The filter manager doesn't unload a minifilter driver until all of its outstanding I/O operations are completed.
