# FLT\_PARAMETERS for IRP\_MJ\_READ union


The following union component is used when the **MajorFunction** field of the [**FLT\_IO\_PARAMETER\_BLOCK**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544638) structure for the operation is [**IRP\_MJ\_READ**](irp-mj-read.md).

Syntax
------

```ManagedCPlusPlus
typedef union _FLT_PARAMETERS {
  ...    ;
  struct {
    ULONG                   Length;
    ULONG POINTER_ALIGNMENT Key;
    LARGE_INTEGER           ByteOffset;
    PVOID                   ReadBuffer;
    PMDL                    MdlAddress;
  } Read;
  ...    ;
} FLT_PARAMETERS, *PFLT_PARAMETERS;
```

Members
-------

**Read**  
Structure containing the following members.

**Length**  
Length, in bytes, of the data to be read.

**Key**  
Key value associated with a byte-range lock on the target file.

**ByteOffset**  
Starting byte offset within the file of the data to be read.

**ReadBuffer**  
Pointer to a buffer that receives the data that is read from the file.

**MdlAddress**  
Address of a memory descriptor list (MDL) that describes the buffer that the **ReadBuffer** member points to. This member is optional and can be **NULL**.

Remarks
-------

The [**FLT\_PARAMETERS**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544673) structure for IRP\_MJ\_READ operations contains the parameters for a read operation represented by a callback data ([**FLT\_CALLBACK\_DATA**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544620)) structure. It is contained in an FLT\_IO\_PARAMETER\_BLOCK structure.

IRP\_MJ\_READ can be an IRP-based operation or a fast I/O operation.
