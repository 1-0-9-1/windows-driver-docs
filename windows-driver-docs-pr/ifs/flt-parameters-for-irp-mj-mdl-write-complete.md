# FLT\_PARAMETERS for IRP\_MJ\_MDL\_WRITE\_COMPLETE union


The following union component is used when the **MajorFunction** field of the [**FLT\_IO\_PARAMETER\_BLOCK**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544638) structure for the operation is IRP\_MJ\_MDL\_WRITE\_COMPLETE.

Syntax
------

```ManagedCPlusPlus
typedef union _FLT_PARAMETERS {
  ...    ;
  struct {
    LARGE_INTEGER FileOffset;
    PMDL          MdlChain;
  } MdlWriteComplete;
  ...    ;
} FLT_PARAMETERS, *PFLT_PARAMETERS;
```

Members
-------

**MdlWriteComplete**  
Structure containing the following members.

**FileOffset**  
Starting byte within the cached file.

**MdlChain**  
Pointer to a variable that receives a pointer to a chain of one or more memory descriptor lists (MDL) that describe the pages that contains the data that was to be written to the cached file.

Remarks
-------

The [**FLT\_PARAMETERS**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544673) structure for IRP\_MJ\_MDL\_WRITE\_COMPLETE operations contains the parameters for a fast I/O **MdlWriteComplete** operation represented by a callback data ([**FLT\_CALLBACK\_DATA**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544620)) structure. It is contained in an FLT\_IO\_PARAMETER\_BLOCK structure.

IRP\_MJ\_MDL\_WRITE\_COMPLETE is a fast I/O operation.
