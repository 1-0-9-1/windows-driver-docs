# File System Drivers


In most situations, developing a full file system driver is not necessary. First consider developing a [file system filter driver](file-system-filter-drivers.md) or a [file system minifilter driver](file-system-minifilter-drivers.md).

This section includes the following topics.

[Installing a File System Driver](installing-a-file-system-driver.md)

[Using Extra Create Parameters with an IRP\_MJ\_CREATE Operation](using-extra-create-parameters-with-an-irp-mj-create-operation.md)
