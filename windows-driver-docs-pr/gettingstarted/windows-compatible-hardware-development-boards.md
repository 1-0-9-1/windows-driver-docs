Leverage the power of the Windows platform and Visual Studio to create innovative experiences and solutions that are brought to life by interfacing hardware components to Windows devices.

Windows compatible hardware development boards offer an affordable, yet a powerful development system targeted towards hardware developer, IHV, OEM or any other developer that loves to incorporate hardware in their projects and needs the power of a full PC. It allows you to easily interface your hardware components to General Purpose I/O (GPIO) pins and low-power buses like I²C and I²S.

    SoC-based hardware development boards enable hardware manufacturers to develop and certify their Windows drivers without time-consuming purchase and licensing processes, and without the need for extensive engagement with Microsoft. Purchasing the boards is quick and easy, and development tips can be found in the MSDN community.

    [Watch the video](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2014/2-536) to learn how Microsoft partnered with vendors like Intel to create easy onboarding opportunities for your off-SOC hardware.
