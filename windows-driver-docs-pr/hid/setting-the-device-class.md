# Setting the Device Class


## <a href="" id="ddk-setting-the-device-class-di"></a>


Joysticks fall under the MEDIA class, the one titled "Sound, video and game controllers" under the Add New Hardware control panel. The class-related sections should be copied from either the examples or the Joystick.inf file.
