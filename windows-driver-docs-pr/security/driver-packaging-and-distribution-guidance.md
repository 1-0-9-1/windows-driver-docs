Distribute digitally-signed driver packages only. If Windows hardware certification has a test procedure for your device setup class, apply for a digital signature for the driver package. If no test procedure exists for the device class, use an appropriate digital signature. A digital signature assures your customers that the driver package has not been tampered with.
