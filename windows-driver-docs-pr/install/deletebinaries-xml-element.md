# deleteBinaries XML Element


\[DIFx is deprecated, for more info, see [DIFx Guidelines](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/drivers/install/difx-guidelines).\]

The **deleteBinaries** XML element is an empty element that sets the **deleteBinaries** flag to ON, which configures DPInst to delete binary files from a system that were copied to the system when a [driver package](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544840) was installed.

**Element Tag**

```
<deleteBinaries>
```

**XML Attributes**

None

Â 

**Remarks**

By default, the **deleteBinaries** flag is set to OFF. To set the **deleteBinaries** flag to ON, include a **deleteBinaries** element as a child element of a **dpinst** element or use the **/d**Â DPInst command-line switch.

The following code example demonstrates a **deleteBinaries** element.

```
<dpinst>
  ...
   <deleteBinaries/>
  ...
</dpinst>
```

**Note**Â Â  Starting with Windows 7, the operating system ignores a setting of ON for the **deleteBinaries** XML element. The binary files, which were copied to a system when a [driver package](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544840) was installed, can no longer be deleted by using DPInst.
