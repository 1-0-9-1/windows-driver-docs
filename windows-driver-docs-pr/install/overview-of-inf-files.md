# Overview of INF Files


## <a href="" id="ddk-creating-an-inf-file-dg"></a>


An INF file is a text file that contains all the information that [device installation components](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff541277) used to install a driver. Windows installs drivers using INF files. This information includes the following:

-   Driver name and location
-   Driver version information
-   Registry information
