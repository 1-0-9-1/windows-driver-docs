# Hardware-First Installation of Device-Specific Applications


During a [hardware-first installation](hardware-first-installation.md), the user installs the device before inserting the distribution medium. If your distribution medium includes device-specific applications, you can use the following methods to start the [*device installation application*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556277#wdkgloss-device-installation-application) which installs those applications:

[Device Installation Application Not Included in the Driver Package](device-installation-application-not-included-in-the-driver-package.md)

[Device Installation Application that is Included in the Driver Package](device-installation-application-that-is-included-in-the-driver-package.md)

[Device Installation Application Started through AutoRun](device-installation-application-started-through-autorun.md)

[Guidelines for Starting Device Installation Applications through Co-installers](guidelines-for-starting-device-installation-applications-through-co-in.md)
