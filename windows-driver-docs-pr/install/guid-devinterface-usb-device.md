Remarks
-------

The system-supplied USB hub driver registers instances of GUID_DEVINTERFACE_USB_DEVICE to notify the system and applications of the presence of USB devices that are attached to a USB hub.

The Microsoft Windows Driver Kit (WDK) includes the [USBVIEW sample application](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=256205). The USBVIEW sample uses the obsolete identifier [**GUID_CLASS_USB_DEVICE**](guid-class-usb-device.md) to register to be notified of the arrival of instances of this device interface class.
