**Note**  If you are unfamiliar with device and driver installation concepts, please read the topics in this section before you read other device and driver installation topics.

 

This section provides a high-level overview of the device installation process.

[Step 1: The New Device is Identified](step-1--the-new-device-is-identified.md)

[Step 2: A Driver for the Device is Selected](step-2--a-driver-for-the-device-is-selected.md)

[Step 3: The Driver for the Device is Installed](step-3--the-driver-for-the-device-is-installed.md)
