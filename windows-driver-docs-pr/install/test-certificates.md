# Test Certificates


A development and test team can use the following types of test certificates to sign a [driver package's](driver-packages.md) [catalog file](catalog-files.md) or to [embed a signature](embedded-signatures-in-a-driver-file.md) in a driver file:

[MakeCert Test Certificate](makecert-test-certificate.md)

[Commercial Test Certificate](commercial-test-certificate.md)

[Enterprise CA Test Certificate](enterprise-ca-test-certificate.md)
