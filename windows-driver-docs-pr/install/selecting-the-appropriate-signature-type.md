Selecting the appropriate signature type for a [driver package](driver-packages.md) depends on the following:

-   [Kernel-Mode Code Signing Requirements](kernel-mode-code-signing-requirements--windows-vista-and-later-.md)
-   [PnP Device Installation Signing Requirements](pnp-device-installation-signing-requirements--windows-vista-and-later-.md)
-   [Authenticode Signing of Third-party CSPs](authenticode-signing-of-csps.md)
