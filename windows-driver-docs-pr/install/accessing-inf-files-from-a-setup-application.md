# Accessing INF Files from a Device Installation Application


## <a href="" id="ddk-accessing-inf-files-from-a-setup-application-dg"></a>


Most INF files are used by system class installers and other [*device installation applications*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556277#wdkgloss-device-installation-application). This section describes common operations that vendor-supplied device installation applications can perform on INF files by using the [general Setup functions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff544985). For complete information about how to use these functions, see the Windows SDK documentation.

This section contains the following topics:

[Opening and Closing an INF File](opening-and-closing-an-inf-file.md)

[Retrieving Information from an INF File](retrieving-information-from-an-inf-file.md)
