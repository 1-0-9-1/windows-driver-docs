# Using Device Manager to Uninstall Devices and Driver Packages


[Device Manager](using-device-manager.md) is a Control Panel application that allows you to manage devices and drivers on your system. You can use Device Manager to uninstall devices and driver packages with some limitations. Typically, an end-user does not use Device Manager to uninstall devices or driver packages, but might have to use Device Manager to troubleshoot problems they might encounter on their computer.

**Note**  You must have administrator privileges to uninstall a device or [driver package](driver-packages.md) by using Device Manager.

 

For more information about uninstalling driver and driver packages, see [How Devices and Driver Packages are Uninstalled](how-devices-and-driver-packages-are-uninstalled.md).

To uninstall a device by using Device Manager, follow these steps:

1.  Start Control Panel, click **Hardware and Sound**, and then click **Device Manager**.

2.  Expand the node that represents the type of device that you want to uninstall, right-click the device entry, and click **Uninstall**.

3.  On the **Confirm Device Removal** dialog box, click **OK** to start the uninstall process.

4.  When the uninstall process is complete, remove the device.

**Note**  With some devices, you might have to restart the system to complete the uninstall process. The device might continue to function until the system has been restarted.
