Remarks
-------

Windows sets the value of DEVPKEY_Device_DriverInfPath. A copy of the INF file that installed a device is located in the system INF file directory. The name of the INF file copy is Oem*Nnn*.inf, where *Nnn* is a decimal number from 0 through 9999.

You can call [**SetupDiGetDeviceProperty**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551963) to retrieve the value of DEVPKEY_Device_DriverInfPath.

Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Windows 2000 support this property, but do not support the DEVPKEY_Device_DriverInfPath property key. On these earlier versions of Windows, you can access the value of this property by accessing the corresponding **InfPath** registry value under the software key for the device instance. For information about how to access this property value on these earlier versions of Windows, see [Accessing Device Driver Properties](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537732).
