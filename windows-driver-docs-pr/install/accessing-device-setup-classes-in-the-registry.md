[Enumerating Installed Device Setup Classes](enumerating-installed-device-setup-classes.md)

[Opening Registry Keys for a Device Setup Class](opening-registry-keys-for-a-device-setup-class.md)

[Opening Software Keys for All Devices in a Setup Class](opening-software-keys-for-all-devices-in-a-setup-class.md)
