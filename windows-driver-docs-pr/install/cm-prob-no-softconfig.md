"Windows cannot determine the settings for this device. Consult the documentation that came with this device and use the Resource tab to set the configuration. (Code 34)"

### Recommended Resolution (Windows 2000 and later versions of Windows)

Change the HW settings (by setting jumpers or running a vendor-supplied utility) and then use Device Manager's **Resources** tab to set the forced configuration.
