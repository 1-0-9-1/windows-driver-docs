# Accessing Device Setup Class Properties


In Windows Vista and later versions of Windows, the [unified device property model](unified-device-property-model--windows-vista-and-later-.md) includes the following:

-   [Device setup class properties](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff542239) that correspond to the SPCRP\_*Xxx* identifiers that are defined in *Setupapi.h.*

-   Properties that do not have SPCRP\_*Xxx* identifiers, but do have corresponding system-defined registry entry values.

For information about how to access device setup class properties in Windows Vista and later versions, see [Accessing Device Class Properties (Windows Vista and Later)](accessing-device-class-properties--windows-vista-and-later-.md).
