Remarks
-------

The value of DEVPKEY_Device_DriverDesc is set by the *device-description* entry value that is supplied by the [**INF *Models* section**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff547456) of the INF file that installs a device.

The value of DEVPKEY_Device_DriverDesc is not displayed in an end-user dialog box or used for any reason by the operating system.

You can call [**SetupDiGetDeviceProperty**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff551963) to retrieve the value of DEVPKEY_Device_DriverDesc.

Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Windows 2000 support this property, but do not support the DEVPKEY_Device_LocationPaths property key. On these earlier versions of Windows, you can access the value of this property by accessing the corresponding **DriverDesc** registry value under the software key for the device instance. For information about how to access this property value on these earlier versions of Windows, see [Accessing Device Driver Properties](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff537732).
