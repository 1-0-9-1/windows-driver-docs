# Device Metadata Packages


Starting with Windows 7, device metadata packages contain XML documents that represent the properties of the device and its hardware functions. The Devices and Printers user interface displays device-specific information to the user based on the XML documents from the device's metadata package.

This section includes the following topics:

[Overview of Device Metadata Packages](overview-of-device-metadata-packages.md)

[Overview of the Device Metadata System](overview-of-the-device-metadata-system.md)

[Device Metadata Package Structure](device-metadata-package-components.md)

[Building Device Metadata Packages](building-device-metadata-packages.md)

[Installing Device Metadata Packages](installing-device-metadata-packages.md)

[How the DMRC Selects a Device Metadata Package](how-the-dmrc-selects-a-device-metadata-package.md)

[Debugging Device Metadata Packages](debugging-device-metadata-packages.md)

[Best Practices for Developing Device Metadata Packages](best-practices-for-developing-device-metadata-packages.md)

**Note**   Device metadata packages are supported on Windows 7 and later versions of Windows.
