# Sample Device Installation Files


## <a href="" id="ddk-sample-device-installation-files-dg"></a>


The Windows Driver Kit (WDK) includes various sample installation files, such as INF files, device installation applications, class installers, co-installers, and property page providers.

Most sample installation files are located under the *src\\setup* subdirectory of the WDK. Also see the *src\\general\\toaster* subdirectory of the WDK.
