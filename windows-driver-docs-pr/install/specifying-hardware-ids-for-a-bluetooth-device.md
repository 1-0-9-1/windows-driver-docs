# Specifying Hardware IDs for a Bluetooth Device


To specify [hardware IDs](hardware-ids.md) for a Bluetooth device within a device metadata package, the device must support the Device Identification (DID) Profile. Otherwise, the operating system cannot select and load the most appropriate device metadata package for the Bluetooth device. We highly recommend that all Bluetooth devices support the DID profile.

For more information about the DID Profile, refer to the [Bluetooth Device Identification Profile specification version 1.3](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=145536).

For information about supporting Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) Device IDs, refer to the [Device Information Service version 1.1](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=242771).
