# Certificate Stores


On a computer that has the Windows operating system installed, the operating system stores a certificate locally on the computer in a storage location called the *certificate store*. A certificate store often has numerous certificates, possibly issued from a number of different certification authorities (CAs).

This section includes the following topics:

[Local Machine and Current User Certificate Stores](local-machine-and-current-user-certificate-stores.md)
