# Installing an Inbox Driver or a Preinstalled Driver


If there is an inbox driver or a [preinstalled driver](preinstalling-driver-packages.md) that matches a device, Windows automatically installs the driver that has the best match to the device. Windows will not prompt the user to insert a distribution medium. In addition, Windows does not attempt to access Windows Update to determine whether there is a Windows Update driver that is a better match than the drivers that are already installed on the computer.

For more information about how driver packages are located during a [hardware-first installation](hardware-first-installation.md), see [Where Windows Searches for Drivers](where-setup-searches-for-drivers.md).

For information about how Windows selects the driver that has the best match to a device, see [How Windows Selects Drivers](how-setup-selects-drivers.md).
