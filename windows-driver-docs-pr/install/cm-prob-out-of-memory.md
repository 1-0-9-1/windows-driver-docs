Running out of memory − the system is probably running low on system memory.

### Error Code

3

### Display Message (Windows 2000 and later versions of Windows)

"The driver for this device might be corrupted, or your system may be running low on memory or other resources. (Code 3)"

### Recommended Resolution (Windows 2000 and later versions of Windows)

If a device driver is corrupted, update the driver.

To update a device driver, follow these steps:

1.  [Open Device Manager](using-device-manager.md).

2.  Right-click the icon that represents the device in the Device Manager window.

3.  On the menu that appears, click **Update Driver** to start the Hardware Update wizard.

If a driver for a device is operating correctly, but the computer has insufficient memory for the device and other applications to operate simultaneously, you could close some applications to make sufficient memory to operate the device.

To check available memory and system resources, follow these steps:

1.  Click the **Start** menu.

2.  Point to the following sequence of submenus: **All Programs**, **Accessories**, and **System Tools**.

3.  On the **System Tools** menu, click **System Information** to determine whether the amount of available physical memory is sufficient to operate the device.

You might have to install additional random access memory (RAM) to operate a device.
