# Driver Packages


A *driver package* consists of all the software components that you must supply in order for your device to be supported under Windows.

Installing a device or driver involves system-supplied and vendor-supplied components. The system provides generic installation software for all device classes. Vendors must supply one or more device-specific components within the driver package.

This section provides information to help you determine which components to supply within your driver package.
