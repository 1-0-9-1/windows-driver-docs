# Code Integrity Event Logging and System Auditing


Code Integrity is the kernel-mode component that implements driver signature verification. It generates system events that are related to image verification and logs the information in the Code Integrity log:

-   The Code Integrity operational log view shows only image verification error events.

-   The Code Integrity verbose log view shows the events for successful signature verifications.

For more information about code integrity event logging and system auditing, see [Code Integrity Diagnostic System Log Events](code-integrity-diagnostic-system-log-events.md).

For more information about how to enable the system audit log and verbose logging, see [Enabling the System Event Audit Log](enabling-the-system-event-audit-log.md).
