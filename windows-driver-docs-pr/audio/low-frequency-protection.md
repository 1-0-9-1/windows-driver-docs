# Low Frequency Protection


Low frequency protection is a form of [forward bass management](bass-management.md). It is used when there is no subwoofer and all the speakers are small and lack bass capability. When you apply the low frequency protection sAPO, the result is the removal of the part of the audio signal that falls below the cut-off frequency that is specified by the algorithm of the sAPO.
