# Bass Boost


In systems such as laptops that have speakers with limited bass capability, it is sometimes possible to increase the perceived quality of the audio by boosting the bass response in the frequency range that is supported by the speaker. Bass boost improves sound on mobile devices with very small speakers by increasing gain in the mid-bass range.
