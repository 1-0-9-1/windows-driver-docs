# WDM Audio Architecture: Basic Concepts


## <span id="wdm_audio_architecture_basic_concepts"></span><span id="WDM_AUDIO_ARCHITECTURE_BASIC_CONCEPTS"></span>


This section presents the basic architectural concepts of [Windows Driver Model](kernel.windows_driver_model) (WDM) audio drivers. The WDM audio architecture is based on kernel streaming (KS) services and is supported in Microsoft Windows 2000 and later and in Windows Me/98. For information about KS services, see [Kernel Streaming](stream.kernel_streaming).

This section discusses the following topics:

[Introduction to WDM Audio Drivers](introduction-to-wdm-audio-drivers.md)

[Audio Filters, Pins, and Nodes](audio-filters--pins--and-nodes.md)

[Audio Endpoints, Properties and Events](audio-endpoints--properties-and-events.md)

[Audio Data Formats and Data Ranges](audio-data-formats-and-data-ranges.md)

[Digital Rights Management](digital-rights-management.md)
