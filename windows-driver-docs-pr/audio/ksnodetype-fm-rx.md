# KSNODETYPE\_FM\_RX


The **KSNODETYPE\_FM\_RX** node represents an FM capture audio endpoint in the system and supports all audio endpoint properties (see [KSPROPSETID\_Audio](kspropsetid-audio.md)). Creating a capture pin on KSNODETYPE\_FM\_RX will allow audio capture from the FM receiver.

The filter associated with the **KSNODETYPE\_FM\_RX** node should support the following additional properties:

[**KSPROPERTY\_FMRX\_ANTENNAENDPOINTID**](ksproperty-fmrx-antennaendpointid.md)

[**KSPROPERTY\_FMRX\_ENDPOINTID**](ksproperty-fmrx-endpointid.md)

[**KSPROPERTY\_FMRX\_STATE**](ksproperty-fmrx-state.md)

[**KSPROPERTY\_FMRX\_VOLUME**](ksproperty-fmrx-volume.md)
