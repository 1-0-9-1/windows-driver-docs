# Speaker Fill


Most music is produced with only two channels and is, therefore, not optimized for the multichannel audio equipment of the typical audio or video enthusiast. So having music emanate from only the front-left and front-right loudspeakers is a less-than-ideal audio experience. Speaker fill simulates a multichannel loudspeaker setup. It allows music that would otherwise be heard on only two speakers to be played on all of the loudspeakers in the room, enhancing the spatial sensation.
