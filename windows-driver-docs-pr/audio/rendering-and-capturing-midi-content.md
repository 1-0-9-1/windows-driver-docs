See the following for a description of the Microsoft Windows Driver Model (WDM) audio components:

[DirectMusic System Component](user-mode-wdm-audio-components.md#directmusic-system-component)

[WDMAud System Driver](user-mode-wdm-audio-components.md#wdmaud-system-driver)

[SBEmul System Driver](kernel-mode-wdm-audio-components.md#sbemul-system-driver)

[SysAudio System Driver](kernel-mode-wdm-audio-components.md#sysaudio-system-driver)

[KMixer System Driver](kernel-mode-wdm-audio-components.md#kmixer-system-driver)

[SWMidi System Driver](kernel-mode-wdm-audio-components.md#swmidi-system-driver)

[DMusic System Driver](kernel-mode-wdm-audio-components.md#dmusic-system-driver)

[Port Class Adapter Driver and PortCls System Driver](kernel-mode-wdm-audio-components.md#port-class-adapter-driver-and-portcls-system-driver)

[USBAudio Class System Driver](kernel-mode-wdm-audio-components.md#usbaudio-class-system-driver)

See the following for more information about the configuration of the port class adapter driver and the USBAudio driver:
