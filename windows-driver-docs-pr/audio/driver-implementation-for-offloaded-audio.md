# Driver Implementation for Offloaded Audio


When you implement a driver for offloaded audio, you develop a driver that is able to process offloaded audio streams, and to expose that ability to the Windows audio system.

The following topics in this section discuss the UI considerations, the application impact and other issues that you should be aware of when you develop an audio driver for an audio adapter that implements a hardware audio engine to handle offloaded audio streams.
