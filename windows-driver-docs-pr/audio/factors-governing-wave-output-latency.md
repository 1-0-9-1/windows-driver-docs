# Factors Governing Wave-Output Latency


## <span id="factors_governing_wave_output_latency"></span><span id="FACTORS_GOVERNING_WAVE_OUTPUT_LATENCY"></span>


This section describes the sources of latency for a wave-output stream. Some of the factors that affect latency are:

-   Whether the stream flows through or bypasses KMixer

-   Whether the stream is output to a WaveCyclic or WavePci device

-   Whether the stream is generated by DirectSound or the **waveOut** API

The following topics are discussed:

[KMixer Latency](kmixer-latency.md)

[WaveCyclic Latency](wavecyclic-latency.md)

[WavePci Latency](wavepci-latency.md)

[Avoiding Data Copying](avoiding-data-copying.md)
