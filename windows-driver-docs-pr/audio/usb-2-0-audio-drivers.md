### Overview

Starting with Windows 10, release 1703, a USB 2.0 driver is shipped with Windows. This driver provides basic functionality including:

- The driver is designed to support the USB Audio 2.0 device class. For more information see [http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/devclass_docs/](http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/devclass_docs/)
- The driver is a WaveRT Audio Port Class
- The driver supports power management including USB selective suspend
- DRM and copy protected content is not supported 

The driver is named: _usbaudio2.sys_ and the associated inf file is _usbaudio2.inf_.

The driver will identify in device manager as "USB Audio Class 2 Device". This name will be overwritten with USB Product string, if it is available.

The driver is automatically enabled for when a compatible device is attached to the system.

### Additional Information for OEM and IHVs

OEMs and IHVs should test their existing and new devices against the supplied in-box driver.

There is not and any specific partner customization that is associated with the in-box USB Audio 2.0 driver.

This INF file entry (provided in a update to Windows Release 1703), is used to indentify that the in-box driver is a generic device driver.

The in-box driver registers for the following compatible IDs

    Class_01 SubClass_00 Prot_20
    Class_01 SubClass_01 Prot_20
    Class_01 SubClass_02 Prot_20
    Class_01 SubClass_03 Prot_20

### IHV USB 2.0 Audio Drivers and Updates
For IHV provided third party driver USB 2.0 drivers, those drivers will continue to be preferred for their devices over our in-box driver unless they update their driver to explicitly override this behavior and use the in-box driver. 


### Driver Development 

This driver was developed by Thesycon and is supported by Microsoft.
