# Customizing Control Panel


In Windows XP and later versions of Windows, you can customize the sound application in Control Panel. To do this, you add a custom bitmap or icon. Or, if you develop a third-party digital audio format that is streamed over SPDIF, you can make this digital audio format available in Control Panel.

For more information about how to add a bitmap or an icon, or how to use an INF file to add a third-party digital audio format to Control Panel, see the following topics:
