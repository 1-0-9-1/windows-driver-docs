# Introduction to Parallel Ports and Devices


## <a href="" id="ddk-introduction-to-parallel-ports-and-devices-kg"></a>


This section describes the following topics about the support that Microsoft Windows provides for parallel ports and devices:

[Physical Configuration of Parallel Ports](physical-configuration-of-parallel-ports.md)

[Physical Configuration of Devices Attached to a Parallel Port](physical-configuration-of-devices-attached-to-a-parallel-port.md)

A parallel port is typically a multimode communication port that supports the following:

-   Byte and nibble (read) modes

-   IEEE 1284-compatibility mode

-   Extended Capabilities Port mode

-   Enhanced Parallel Port mode

For information about parallel port and device standards, see the following specifications:

-   *IEEE Std 1284-1994, IEEE Standard Signaling Method for a Bidirectional Parallel Peripheral Interface for Personal Computers*

-   *IEEE P1284.3, Standard for Interface and Protocol Extensions to IEEE 1284-1994 Compliant Peripherals and Host Adapters, Draft D6.00, December 3, 1998*

For more information about Windows support for parallel ports and devices, see:

[System-Supplied Parallel Drivers](system-supplied-parallel-drivers.md)

[Vendor-Supplied Parallel Drivers](vendor-supplied-parallel-drivers.md)

[Client Interfaces to System-Supplied Parallel Drivers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543926)
