# Sample WDTF Scenarios


You can access WDTF-based scenario scripts provided with the WDK. To find these and other samples, open Windows Explorer and navigate to the Testing\\Samples\\WDTF directory of your WDK installation (for example, C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\8.0\\Testing\\Samples\\WDTF\\Tests).

**Note**   If you plan to make copies of these scripts for your own testing, make sure that you update your scripts with every new release of the WDK. These sample scripts might change at each release. For the most accurate testing, make sure to incorporate any revisions of these scripts into your scripts.
