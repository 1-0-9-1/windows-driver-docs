The UserDump tool (Userdump.exe), also known as User-Mode Process Dump, can create user-mode dump files.

UserDump and its documentation are part of the OEM Support Tools package.

For more info and to download these tools, see [How to use the Userdump.exe tool to create a dump file](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=241339) and follow the instructions on that page. Additionally, When CDB or WinDbg is debugging a user-mode application, you can also use the [.dump (Create Dump File) command](-dump--create-dump-file-.md) to create a dump file.
