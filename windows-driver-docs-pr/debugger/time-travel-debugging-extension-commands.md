This section describes how to  section describes how to use the how to use the time travel debugger extensions.


## !ttdext navigation commands

Use the !ttdext.tt command to navigate forward or backwards in time, by traveling to a given position in the trace. 

!ttdext.tt {position}

Provide a time position in any of the following formats to travel to that point in time.
           
- If {position} is a decimal number between 0 and 100, it travels to approximately that percent into the trace. For example:
    - !ttdext.tt 0                   - Time travel to the beginning of the trace
    - !ttdext.tt 50                  - Time travel to halfway through the trace
    - !ttdext.tt 100                 - Time travel to the end of the trace
 

- If {position} is #:#, where # are a hexadecimal numbers, it travels to that position. If the number after : is omitted, it defaults to zero.
    - !ttdext.tt 1A0:                - Time travel to position 1A0:0
    - !ttdext.tt 1A0:0               - Time travel to position 1A0:0
    - !ttdext.tt 1A0:12F             - Time travel to position 1A0:12F




## !ttdext Extension utility commands

Use the following !ttdext extension commands to work with TTD traces.


### !ttdext.index

Use !ttdext.*index* to run an indexing pass over the current trace. 

```
0:000> !index
Indexed 10/14 keyframes
Indexed 14/14 keyframes
Successfully created the index in 535ms.

```

If the current trace is already indexed, the !ttdext.index command does nothing.

```
0:000> !ttdext.index
Successfully created the index in 0ms.
```

### !ttdext.index -status

Use !tt.index -status to report the status of the trace index.

```
0:000> !tt.index -status
Index file loaded.
```

This section describes the Human Interface Device (HID) debugger extension commands.

The HID debugger extension commands are implemented in Hidkd.dll. To load the HID commands, enter **.load hidkd.dll** in the debugger.

To start debugging a HID issue, enter the [**!hidtree**](-hidkd-hidtree.md) command. The **!hidtree** command displays a list of commands and addresses that you can use to investigate device objects, preparsed HID data, and HID report descriptors.
