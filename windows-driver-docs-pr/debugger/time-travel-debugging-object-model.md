## Querying a Time Travel Trace â€“ dx namespaces and commands


The Lifetime, Threads and Events TTD objects are associated with the current process (curprocess). Use the dx command to view these TTD Objects.

```
0:000> dx @$curprocess.TTD 
@$curprocess.TTD  
    Lifetime         : [97:0, 113:0]
    Threads         
    Events          
```


Use dx to query for what you are looking for. 

Examples:
- Querying for exceptions:

```
dx @$curprocess.TTD.Events.Where(t => t.Type == "Exception").Select(e => e.Exception) 

```

- Querying for the load event(s) of a particular module
```

```
dx @$curprocess.TTD.Events.Where(t => t.Type == "ModuleLoaded").Where(t => t.Module.Name.Contains("ntdll.dll")) 
```
- Querying for the threads that get created

```
dx -g @$curprocess.TTD.Events.Where(t => t.Type == "ThreadCreated").Select(t => t.Thread) 

```
