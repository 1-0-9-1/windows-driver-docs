# ![Small logo on windbg preview](images/windbgx-preview-logo.png) Time Travel Debugging - Object Model


This section describes how to use the data model to query time travel traces. This can be a powerful tool to answer ask questions like these about the code that is captured in a a time travel trace.

- What exceptions are in the trace?
- What thread spent the most time running?
- At what point in time in the trace did a specific code module load?

- Check slide deck ... and 

For more information about objects described here, see [Debugger Object model reference - Time Travel Debugging](debugger-object-model-reference-time-travel-debugging.md).


## Querying a Time Travel Trace â€“ dx namespaces and commands


The Lifetime, Threads and Events TTD objects are associated with the current process (curprocess). Use the dx command to view these TTD Objects.

```
0:000> dx @$curprocess.TTD 
@$curprocess.TTD  
    Lifetime         : [97:0, 113:0]
    Threads         
    Events          
```

Use the dx command to query for what you are looking for. 

## Examples

### Querying for exceptions

This LINQ query displays all of the exceptions in the trace.

```
dx @$curprocess.TTD.Events.Where(t => t.Type == "Exception").Select(e => e.Exception) 

```

### Querying for the load event for a specific module

This LINQ query displays the load event(s) of a particular module

```
dx @$curprocess.TTD.Events.Where(t => t.Type == "ModuleLoaded").Where(t => t.Module.Name.Contains("ntdll.dll")) 
```

Use the [lm]() command to display the modules currently loaded

```
TBD
``` 

### Querying for the time postion in the trace when threads that get created

This LINQ query for the time postion in the trace when threads that get created

```
dx -g @$curprocess.TTD.Events.Where(t => t.Type == "ThreadCreated").Select(t => t.Thread) 
===========================================================================================================
=                             = (+) UniqueId = (+) Id    = (+) Lifetime                 = (+) ActiveTime  =
===========================================================================================================
= [0x0] : UID: 2, TID: 0x4C2C - 0x2          - 0x4c2c    - [0:0, FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFE:0]    - [D:0, 64:0]     =
= [0x1] : UID: 3, TID: 0x4CFC - 0x3          - 0x4cfc    - [0:0, 8A:0]                  - [69:0, 8A:0]    =
= [0x2] : UID: 4, TID: 0x27B0 - 0x4          - 0x27b0    - [0:0, 89:0]                  - [6A:0, 89:0]    =
===========================================================================================================
```
