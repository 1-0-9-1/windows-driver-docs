# Debugger Data Model C++ Interfaces Overview

This topic describes how to use Debugger Data Model C++ Interfaces to extend and customize the capabilities of the debugger.

This page is part of a series on which describes the interfaces accessible from C++, how to use them to build a C++ based
debugger extension, and how to make use of other data model constructs (e.g.: JavaScript or NatVis) from a C++ data model extension.
