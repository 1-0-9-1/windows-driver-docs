# ![Small logo on windbg preview](images/windbgx-preview-logo.png) !index

The **!index** extension indexes time travel traces or displays index status information.

```
!index [-status] [-force] 
```


Use ```!index``` to run an indexing pass over the current trace. 

```
0:000> !index
Indexed 10/14 keyframes
Indexed 14/14 keyframes
Successfully created the index in 535ms.
```

If the current trace is already indexed, the !index command does nothing.

```
0:000> !index
Successfully created the index in 0ms.
```
