## Public and private repos

The driver docs are hosted on two different sites.

If you are not a Microsoft employee, please use the [public content repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/windows-driver-docs).

If you are a Microsoft employee, we recommend that you work in our [private content repository](https://cpubwin.visualstudio.com/drivers/_git/drivers).  

## Providing feedback on Windows driver documentation

You can point out errors, suggest changes, or request new topics by [creating an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) on the 
[windows-driver-docs repository issues page](https://github.com/Microsoft/windows-driver-docs/issues).

Issues are reviewed regularly by members of the Windows driver documentation team, and are triaged, assigned, and addressed accordingly.

All of the documentation hosted in this repo is written using [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/).

## Editing topics

To edit an existing file, simply navigate to it and click the "Edit" button. 
If you're using the GitHub-based public repo, GitHub will automatically create your own fork of our repository where you can make your changes. 
If you're using the VSO-based private repo, use the drop-down arrow next to the Commit button and select **Commit to new branch**.
Once you're finished, submit a pull request to the *master* branch of the repository. 
After your pull request is created, someone on the Windows driver documentation team reviews your changes.

If your request is accepted, updates are published to https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/drivers.
