# Contributing to Windows Driver Documentation
The following is a short introduction for contributing to Windows Driver Documentation. For more in depth guidance about setup and contributing, see the [Windows Driver Documentation Contributors' Guide Index] (./contributor-guide).
## Quick Start

You only need to do the first two steps the first time you contribute.

1. To start contributing, [fork] (./contributor-guide/tools-and-setup.md#fork-the-repository-and-copy-it-to-your-computer) the repository into your own GitHub account. 
2. Log into the [Open Publishing portal](https://op-portal-prod.azurewebsites.net/#/containers/repository/repositories/All) with your GitHub credentials.
3. Edits can be made within the GitHub UI or through a clone on your local computer. The GitHub UI is easy to use for minor edits, but we recommend using a local clone for large changes. To learn the Git commands for working locally, see [Git commands for creating a new article or updating an existing article](./contributor-guide/git-commands-for-master.md).
4. When you've finished making your changes, submit them for approval by opening a pull request back to the official repository. 
5. The documentation owner will review your request and follow up with changes if necessary. 
6. Once your request is accepted into the `windows-driver-docs-pr` repo, you'll be able to view your staged content by selecting the appropriate branch in the upper right of the corresponding page on: https://msdnstage.redmond.corp.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/drivers.
7. After contributor and content owner sign off, updates will be published to https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/drivers.
