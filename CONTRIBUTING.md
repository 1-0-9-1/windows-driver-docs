# Contributing to Windows Driver Documentation
The following is a short introduction for contributing to Windows Driver Documentation. For more in depth guidance about setup and contributing, see the [Install and set up tools for authoring in VSO] (./contributor-guide/tools-and-setup.md).
## Quick Start

3. Edits can be made within the VSO UI or through a clone on your local computer. The VSO UI is easy to use for minor edits, but we recommend using a local clone for large changes. To learn the Git commands for working locally, see [Git commands for creating a new article or updating an existing article](./contributor-guide/git-commands-for-master.md).
4. When you've finished making your changes, submit them for approval by opening a pull request back to the official repository. 
5. The documentation owner will review your request and follow up with changes if necessary. 
6. Once your request is accepted into the `drivers` repo, you'll be able to view your staged content by selecting the appropriate branch in the upper right of the corresponding page on  https://msdnstage.redmond.corp.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/drivers.
7. After contributor and content owner sign off, updates will be published to https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/drivers.
